  As you play League of Legends, you\u2019ll hear various terms like AP Damage,
  Attack Damage, Burst Damage, DPS, etc. It is enough to leave any new player
  wondering and questioning \u2013 Just what the hell does all of this mean?
  Well, as always, we\u2019ve got you covered.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  In this article, our focus is on DPS. But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll cover
  the other ones eventually.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

<p>
  DPS stands for
  <em
    >Damage per second. <\/em>This is a term used to describe how much Damage a
    Champion deals over a period of time. DPS is usually used in relation to a
    <em
      >longer<\/em> duration rather than a short and quick
      one.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
      <p>
        This means that
        <em
          >low<\/em> DPS Champions are those that have long delays between their
          damage outputs. For example, a Champion like Lux can deal massive
          Damage with her infamous spells, especially her Ultimate. But, when
          these are exhausted, Lux must retreat from the frontline to wait for
          her cooldowns to expire. This creates a gap in her
          <em
            >Damage per second<\/em>, meaning that she\u2019ll deal less than
            high DPS Champions over a longer period.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            <p>
              But what is
              <em
                >high DPS<\/em>? Well, let\u2019s take Jinx, for example. Jinx
                is an ADC, meaning she hits hard and she hits fast. Jinx also
                has good buffs in her kit that give her good attack speed
                boosts, allowing her to dish out Damage even faster. In the same
                duration as Lux, Jinx will just keep hammering the enemy. She
                deals continuous and large Damage during a longer period, i.e.,
                she deals
                <em
                  >higher Damage <\/em><strong
                    ><em
                      >per<\/em><\/strong><strong>
                        <\/strong><em
                          >second.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          <p>
                            So, to put it into perspective: A low DPS Champion
                            has to
                            <em
                              >wait<\/em> a significant amount of time to deal
                              Damage, while a high DPS Champion uses continuous
                              attacks and Damage to stay on top during the
                              entire fight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                is exactly and how it works as one of
