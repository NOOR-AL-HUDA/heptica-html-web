Vayne Carry in Solo Queue?"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  I\u2019m pretty sure a couple of you flinched just reading the title.
  That\u2019s because Vayne is one of those grotesque champions that can take
  over a game if she gets the chance. You\u2019re comfortable, winning 2\/0 in
  the mid lane, when you suddenly see Vayne come up and immediately ult, melting
  your entire health bar in three swift autos. Surprised, you tab and see she is
  15\/0, and it\u2019s only the 10th minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  Most of us know that Vayne can absolutely carry a game in League of Legends,
  so let us talk more about how she\u2019s able to do that and some
  recommendations if you do decide to try and carry with her
  yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<h2>
  <strong
    >Is Vayne Good to Climb With?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n
    <p>
      Vayne currently boasts a <a
      href=\"https:\/\/www.leagueofgraphs.com\/champions\/builds\/vayne\">52%
      win rate <\/a>in the bottom lane, tied at the top spot with Miss Fortune
      and Ziggs. This on its own is an excellent piece of evidence to show Vayne
      is a very strong pick in the current meta. This, however, is only
      emphasized by one really important fact: she is a flex pick for the top
      lane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, ADCs typically struggle top lane, because yes, they might be annoying
      to deal with in the early levels, but the enemy top laner can just armor
      up, and well, that\u2019s that, you can\u2019t really do much to them
      anymore. Vayne doesn\u2019t really care how much armor you stack, thanks
      to her W &#8211; Silver Bolts, which does true damage equal to a certain
      percentage of the target\u2019s max health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong
        >Is Vayne Difficult to Play?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n
        <p>
          It\u2019s commonly known that Vayne has a fairly high skill ceiling,
          not because she is difficult to understand but rather because she is
          <a
          href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/the-most-difficult-league-of-legends-champions\/\"
          data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8685\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
          noopener\">difficult to really master<\/a>. Vayne doesn\u2019t really
          have an overly complex kit. The only castable abilities are her Q and
          E since her W is a passive ability and her ult is essentially a
          temporary buff. That being said, the trick is not in her kit, per se,
          but rather in utilizing it effectively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Vayne has one of the shortest overall ranges in ADCs because while she
          doesn\u2019t have the shortest attack range, she lacks abilities to
          poke from afar. Champions that have shorter auto ranges than Vayne
          have other abilities with bigger ranges to poke. For example,
          Kai\u2019Sa has her Q and W, Xayah has her passive and Q, Samira has
          Q, and this is the case for all ADCs with a shorter range than Vayne.
          This basically means Vayne needs to be very \u201cin-your-face\u201d
          to deal any real damage, so Vayne\u2019s skill expression lies in her
          positioning and kiting. That is what makes a good Vayne stand out so
          much more than the average.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <h2>
          <strong
            >Why is Vayne so Good?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n
            <p>
              Vayne is scary because of her W. Vayne is pretty much the only
              champion in the game that can consistently dish out obscene
              amounts of true damage. Well known as a tank killer, it
              doesn\u2019t matter how much the enemy has stacked health or
              armor; a good chunk of their health bar will vanish once you proc
              her W on them. This makes Vayne a big threat to the enemy as not
              even their front line will be able to soak up her damage for
              long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              This, however, is a double-edged sword, as the enemy team will
              quickly identify Vayne as the primary damage dealer and thus the
              first champion they need to take out. This means that a lot of key
              abilities and often ults will be saved specifically for Vayne to
              shut her out before she can melt the team down. Given that Vayne
              is really squishy, it is unlikely for her to survive a hard engage
              of this nature unless she has really good peeling on her
              side.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, you do have plenty of tools of your own to try
              to weave through the enemy team and deal your damage. The move
              speed bonus on your ultimate is a nice addition to maneuver around
              champions, especially if you\u2019re looking to reach the
              backline. The stealth that your ult adds to your Q is exceptional
              in repositioning and dropping aggro from the enemy team. Even if
              it is just a short while, losing sight of you will give the enemy
              team cold sweats, as they will anxiously wait for your return to
              turn their focus on you again. This can also give your team a
              short window to act since the enemy will be busy worrying about
              you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              As Vayne, you pretty much want to fight on the sides of
              teamfights. You\u2019re not a real backliner; you lack the range
              to do that; you\u2019re not Jinx who can spit out rockets from
              half the lane away; you need to get up close to be effective. As a
              tip, try to have only one champion in range at a time, as your
              damage is single target; you have to work through the enemy team
              one by one. Having more than one enemy nearby opens you to
              retaliation from more than one champion, which can be tricky to
              deal with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                      Vayne is the bane of bot lane because of these advantages
                      that were mentioned before. People know how easily she can
                      wipe out an entire team and will desperately try to avoid
                      that at all costs. It is not uncommon for a Vayne player
                      to be on the receiving end of a Malphite flashing in and
                      ulting specifically her, immediately followed by a
                      Nocturne ult into her, or pretty much any sort of hard
                      engage that would shut Vayne out before the fight even
                      begins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                              playing this champion, I do want to go back to the
                              stats. That 52% win rate proves that it is
