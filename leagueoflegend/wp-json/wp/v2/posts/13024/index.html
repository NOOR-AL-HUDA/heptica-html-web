  Sion is probably one of the most unique champions that you can play within
  League of Legends. Building upon the archetype of the undying brute who is
  built to take damage-come what may-Sion is a favorite of players who like to
  play a tank in the top lane. More recently, players have experimented with him
  in the bot-lane as support as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

        <p>
          Sion&#8217;s passive is called &#8220;Glory in Death&#8221;. If Sion
          is killed, his dead body is reanimated to fight nearby enemies.
          However, after dying, his revived corpse has rapidly declining health
          but can hurt enemies more based on their missing health and can also
          regenerate health from inflicting damage on enemies. His
          &#8220;Q&#8221; i.e., the Decimating Smash, can knock up enemies if
          sufficiently charged. His Soul Furnace (His &#8220;W&#8221;) creates a
          shield around him and can be reactivated to inflict magic damage on
          nearby enemies. With his &#8220;E&#8221; (Roar of the Slayer), he can
          reduce the Armor of enemies who are caught in his line of attack. And
          finally, his ultimate is the Unstoppable Onslaught. He can dash a
          long-distance and knock up enemies who get hit in the way. The damage
          dealt to enemies is based on the distance of Sion&#8217;s
          dash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

        <p>
          All that being said, a lot of the times Riot has some mechanics hidden
          in champion abilities. You can&#8217;t simply read off menus and
          player guides to discover these mechanics. Sometimes you just have to
          find out for yourself by playing League and experimenting in different
          ways. For example, Sion&#8217;s ultimate may have some hidden effects
          as well, such as damaging turrets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                <p>
                  Sion has a very unique Ultimate in that he dashes a
                  long-distance across the map and knocks up and damages the
                  first enemy hit. Often when Sion begins his dash with
                  &#8220;R&#8221;, the sound effect of his ultimate is heard
                  across the map and sends enemies panicking and looking over
                  their shoulders because SIon can come from a very long
                  distance with Unstoppable Onslaught. But the hidden mechanic
                  mentioned earlier is the fact that you can damage enemy
                  turrets using Sion&#8217;s Ultimate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure

                  This ability allows Sion for a lot of back-door potentials
                  during the late game because Sion can dash across half the
                  length of the map to damage enemy turrets. In the early game,
                  it just means you can rush in and take down enemy turrets more
                  quickly. Either way, you can pile up the pressure on the enemy
                  team.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"
