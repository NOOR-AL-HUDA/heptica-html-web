  LoL, and Dota 2 are the most popular video games in this field. Both of them
  have masses and masses of followers, although one surpasses the other.

        <p>
          It might be well known that Dota 2 didn&#8217;t start as a standalone
          game. Back in the days when there was no League of Legends, Defence of
          the Ancients was just a game mode in Warcraft III. Now, WC3 was a big
          hit worldwide, so the mode quickly overtook the world. It introduced a
          5v5 PvP arena with much complexity and &#8220;fairness&#8221; where
          friends can battle their way to glory through both strategy and
          skill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Years forwards, Valve purchased the rights for Dota from Blizzard.
          They rebranded it into Dota 2 and removed every bit of Warcraft III
          from their game. New hero designs, new looks, new names\u2026 It
          launched on <a
          href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/570\/Dota_2\/\"
          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Steam<\/a> and soon
          became one of the biggest Esports scenes. And even though the game has
          almost no similarity, the die-hard fans of WC3 can still spot all the
          similarities between Dota 2 and its former self.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, League of Legends wasn&#8217;t created by random
          strangers that liked a challenge. Rumors are that many of the
          developers that worked on Warcraft III and World of Warcraft at
          Blizzard during that time transitioned over to Riot Games to work on
          LoL instead. Of course, Dota&#8217;s game mode wasn&#8217;t supported
          in any way by Blizzard, so it was only a matter of time when a team
          would want to flash out its potential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          So, LoL was created to provide a unique, authentic, and powerful 5v5
          PvP experience. In the start, it had many trials and errors, but with
          time Riot Games and the community have made it to what it is today
          &#8211; the loudest name in the world of Esports!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              When I say graphics, I mostly mean the entire technical aspect of
              the game. I start with this because you undoubtedly wonder if you
              can even run a game before downloading it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              League of Legends runs on a proprietary engine built by
              <strong
                >Riot Games<\/strong> themselves. It is notoriously easy to run
                on a variety of systems, even those older ones. Being a game
                released in 2009. this is a no-brainer, and though it did
                receive some graphical\/technological updates, the game remains
                a non-demanding title that most people can play without much
                issue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                <p>
                  League of Legends recommends a 3GHz CPU, at least 4 Gigs of
                  RAM, and a DirectX 9.0c GPU with
                  <strong

                    <p>
                      DOTA 2 runs on the Source 2 Engine built by
                      <strong
                        >VALVe. <\/strong>Despite the Source engine\u2019s
                        reputation of performing well on hardware that\u2019s
                        even a
                        <strong
                          >decade<\/strong> old, the upgraded Source 2 version
                          is a bit more demanding than its
                          predecessor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          <p>
                            DOTA 2 was initially built on Source 1, which is
                            good news for people with older hardware who would
                            like to check the game out. Other than some
                            infrastructural things, DOTA 2 takes barely anything
                            from the new and updated Source
                            2.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            But even so, it is much more demanding than the
                            alternative. Those who expect at least 30 to 45 FPS
                            in League should expect a 30% decrease in
                            performance in DOTA 2.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            DOTA 2 has impressive graphics and a great map,
                            making the FPS trade-off worth it for some eye candy
                            connoisseurs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            DOTA 2 requires at least a dual-core CPU running at
                            2.8GHz or higher, 4 Gigs of RAM, and a DirectX 9.0c
                            GPU or better. We can see that DOTA 2\u2019s minimum
                            requirements are that of what League
                            recommends.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            If you have the hardware, give both games a try and
                            see which one performs better for you before making
                            premature judgments.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                games are termed differently. LoL has its
                                champions, and Dota 2 has its heroes. When you
                                first start playing League of Legends,
                                you&#8217;ll see that you have a limited
                                champion pool to choose from. And you&#8217;ll
                                have to work towards unlocking more and more
                                characters. However, in Dota 2, you have all
                                heroes unlocked at the start, so you can pick
                                whichever you want to main right

                                    Well, the style of play in League of Legends
                                    is such that most champions are designed on
                                    one fundamental &#8211; skill shots. Skill
                                    shots are abilities that you need to aim,
                                    either at a targeted location or a chosen
                                    trajectory, rather than just pressing them
                                    directly onto the enemy. Think of
                                    Ashe&#8217;s R or Mirana&#8217;s arrow. And
                                    based on percentage, League of Legends has
                                    much, much more skill shots than Dota
                                    2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                    Another element that comes into play is the
                                    fact that more heroes in Dota 2 have passive
                                    abilities in the place of the active ones.
                                    Traditionally in LoL, every champion has an
                                    active spell on the Q, W, E, and R buttons,
                                    while all having a passive effect that
                                    defines their playstyle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                  </p>

                                        One of the biggest differences between
                                        Dota 2 and League of Legends are their
                                        rules on roles and builds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                        In Dota 2, they exist only vaguely,
                                        though. Every team needs to have a carry
                                        and somewhat of a <a
                                        href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/5-best-off-meta-supports\/\"

                                        They&#8217;re helped by constant ganking
                                        of all the other members of the team and
                                        vice versa. The heroes are of either of
                                        the three categories: Strength, Agility,
                                        and Intelligence. Each has its own build
                                        path and ways to deal with its
                                        enemy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                        But in League of Legends, there are
                                        fixed rules for every role! The top
                                        laner should almost always be a tank or
                                        at least a melee fighter who can endure
                                        many hits. The mid laner is responsible
                                        for doing as much damage as possible
                                        with a mage or an assassin style of a
                                        champion. In the bot lane, there is
                                        always a ranged carry champion and a
                                        supportive one. They both work towards
                                        the same goal of getting the carry as
                                        powerful as possible. And lastly, the
                                        jungler is responsible for roaming
                                        everywhere and enabling his lanes for
                                        success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                                League of Legends is more or
                                                less a simplified version of the
                                                original DOTA All-Stars custom
                                                map. At first, it was chaotic,
                                                and roles were a lot closer to
                                                what was present in DOTA, but as
                                                time passed, League grew into an
                                                orderly game where everyone had
                                                a part to play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                                roles and Riot\u2019s active
                                                influence on creating a
                                                particular gameplay system in
                                                their MOBA alienated League from
                                                its alternative. Of course, the
                                                roles in League of Legends are
                                                Top-Mid-Jungle-Bot, a structure
                                                that Riot blatantly works on
                                                keeping, cutting down any
                                                divergence from it (i.e. Funnel,

                                                League of Legends is faster, the
                                                map is smaller, and the overall
                                                game lasts a lot shorter. The
                                                Champions are all structured
                                                around one of the roles
                                                mentioned above and, though
                                                there can be some versatility,
                                                most fall within a mold that
                                                Riot envisions for
