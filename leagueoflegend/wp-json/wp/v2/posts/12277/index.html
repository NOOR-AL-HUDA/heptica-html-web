5 Most Fun Junglers in Season 11"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  Jungle has always been a versatile role. Since the beginning of League of
  Legends, we&#8217;ve seen many different types of champions excel at it,
  everything from fighters, tanks, and assassins to mages and marksmen. And
  while melee champions are typically better picks in the jungle, ranged
  junglers can also be effective. But who are the most fun junglers in League of
  Legends?<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  Well, everyone has a different way of answering this question. And frankly
  speaking, everyone enjoys different playstyles in LoL. However, there are also
  some champions that everybody likes or at least agrees that they&#8217;re fun.
  And you&#8217;ll recognize them here!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  So let&#8217;s take a look at the top 5 most fun junglers in League of
  Legends!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

        <p>
          For many people,
          <strong
            >Kha&#8217;Zix<\/strong> is a synonym for the jungle role.
            He&#8217;s been an iconic pick season after season and has rarely
            been considered a weak champion. Sure, the tank meta from a couple
            of years back didn&#8217;t quite suit his assassination playstyle,
            he&#8217;s found success even then. But now, Kha&#8217;Zix is one of
            the strongest champions in League, able to carry games by himself.
            And when we say Kha&#8217;Zix can carry, we mean even 1v9
            games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            <p>
              Kha&#8217;Zix has an interesting ability kit, the first of his
              kind, really. Upon reaching levels 6, 11, or 18, Kha&#8217;Zix can
              choose whether to evolve his Q, W, E, or R. Evolving an ability
              improves it and grants it an additional effect.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if Kha&#8217;Zix evolves his E, then the range of his
              E is increased and it resets every time he scores a kill or an
              assist. And if he evolves his ultimate, then he becomes red
              instead of blue and can enter invisibility 3 times instead of
              2.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              And since this system only allows 3 abilities to be evolved per
              game, the player has to make a choice which 3 abilities he will
              upgrade. One effect will always be left behind, which forces you
              to think about your choices. And in my opinion, this tool kit
              design should be a primary example of how Riot should create their
              champions. Customizing your champion in game is way more fun than
              simply choosing a champion that is overloaded with 10 passive
              effects every game!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              All in all, Kha&#8217;Zix can be a helpful pick in any type of
              situation. He usually prefers to play alone and assassinate the
              enemy carries when they&#8217;re alone. So if you like assassins,
              then Kha is definitely for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                    <p>
                      <strong
                        >Nidalee<\/strong> is one of the most popular champions
                        in League. And one of the most difficult ones too. She
                        first started as a mid laner but was later reworked into
                        a jungle champion. Nidalee is now a top-tier jungle pick
                        that mostly focuses on getting advantages in the early
                        game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        <p>
                          What makes Nidalee a very fun champion to play is the
                          variety in her playstyle. As most of you know, Nidalee
                          can change her form from humanoid to cougar and vice
                          versa. By entering one of these forms, she gains a set
                          of abilities. But switching to another form grants her
                          access to new abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For example, Nidalee can toss spears, place traps, and
                          heal herself (or allies) in her humanoid form. But in
                          the cougar form, Nida can bite a champion from melee
                          range, swipe to deal AoE damage, and pounce around the
                          map. Changing forms only has a couple of seconds
                          cooldown, essentially giving you two champions into
                          one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          So playing Nidalee is almost always engaging and
                          exciting. You have to think about things like placing
                          traps and poking enemies, but also about jumping into
                          melee range and assassinating carries. It&#8217;s
                          definitely a pick for players that enjoy complexity
                          and are okay with doing extra things in order to
                          achieve victory.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Another thing that contributes to Nidalee being a fun
                          pick is her recommended build. The items that players
                          usually purchase on Nida are Luden&#8217;s Tempest,
                          Void Staff, and Zhonya&#8217;s Hourglass. With a full
                          AP build, Nidalee can almost one-shot an enemy ADC
                          with one spear. So we suggest you try her
                          out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                            <p>
                              <strong
                                >Viego<\/strong> is one of the newest additions
                                to the jungle role. He has quite a unique
                                playstyle, one that no other champion can mimic.
                                He&#8217;s a powerful pick in the early game,
                                but his strengths really get to shine after
                                level 6.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                <p>
                                  If there is one thing that truly distinguishes
                                  Viego from the rest of the characters in
                                  League of Legends is his passive &#8211;
                                  Sovereign&#8217;s Domination. This effect
                                  allows him to play as a recently slain enemy
                                  champion. And when we say play, we mean it
                                  literally!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Viego gets to use all of the basic abilities
                                  of his slain enemies, aside from their
                                  ultimates. This creates such diversity in his
                                  playstyle that not even Sylas can match. So
                                  this playstyle changes from game to game
                                  because, in every match, there are new sets of
                                  enemies that Viego can possess. So often, the
                                  success that Viego can achieve is measured by
                                  the player&#8217;s knowledge of all the other
                                  champions in the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Aside from this one-of-a-kind mechanic, Viego
                                  also has unique abilities on his own. His W
                                  sends a wave that can dash him forward and
                                  stun the target. And his E marks an area in
                                  which Viego can remain invisible. His R is
                                  often compared to that of Pyke, so only fun
                                  tools all around!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  The way most people play Viego is by going for
                                  a hybrid build of fighter and assassin items.
                                  Yes, this makes him a bit squishier than most
                                  bruisers, but his lifesteal potential is
                                  bigger than any other
                                  champion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  In the end, you have this very interesting
                                  playstyle where you constantly fight and heal
                                  without a limitation. So Viego is one of the
                                  most fun junglers in LoL!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                            >Shaco<\/strong> is one of the most
                                            exciting characters in League of
                                            Legends. Although he is most popular
                                            in the jungle role, players like to
                                            take him in the bot and top lanes
                                            too. He is another hybrid champion
                                            that can either build AP or AD. And
                                            because of that, his playstyle
                                            changes from game to
                                            game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                            <p>
                                              In the lore, Shaco is an evil
                                              marionette that finds pleasure in
                                              tormenting other living souls. And
                                              his ability kit in game perfectly
                                              matches that
                                              description.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                              In other words, Shaco has all the
                                              necessary tools to make someone
                                              start inting! Not only does his Q
                                              grant him invisibility, but it
                                              also teleports him in a chosen
                                              direction. This allows him to pick
                                              up Ignite and Smite instead of
                                              being forced to play the game with
                                              Flash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                              Additionally, Shaco can place
                                              boxes around the map. But unlike
                                              Nidalee&#8217;s traps,
                                              Shaco&#8217;s boxes cast fear on
                                              the enemy champion upon
                                              triggering. They scale with
                                              ability power, so that&#8217;s why
                                              AP Shaco support can be so
                                              dangerous nowadays.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                              And lastly, we have Shaco&#8217;s
                                              ultimate &#8211; Hallucinate. Upon
                                              using this ability, Shaco creates
                                              a clone of himself that he can
                                              control for a long period of time.
                                              This clone mimics Shaco&#8217;s
                                              auto-attacks, which can be quite
                                              confusing to many players. In all
                                              ways, Shaco&#8217;s clone acts the
                                              same as the champion, except that
                                              it doesn&#8217;t cast abilities.
                                              But the level of trickery you can
                                              do with this ability is really
                                              insane. Talking about finding
                                              pleasure in tormenting others,
                                              huh?<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                              In all seriousness, Shaco is an
                                              amazing champion. Not everybody
                                              likes his wacky playstyle, but the
                                              fact remains that he is one of the
                                              most fun junglers in League of
