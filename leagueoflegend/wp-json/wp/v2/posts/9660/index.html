Most Fun Champions in League of Legends"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  How do we measure which champions are the most fun to play in League of
  Legends? When the game is <a
  href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/League_of_Legends\" target=\"_blank\"
  rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">over 10 years old<\/a>, and the <a
  href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/how-many-champions-are-in-league-of-legends\/\"
  data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8630\">champion pool<\/a> is larger than 150,
  it\u2019s tough to find just a few shining examples. That\u2019s because, in
  League, there are characters of all styles. By now, we\u2019ve seen all kinds
  of unique abilities, mechanics, philosophies\u2026 and every player has his
  own favorite champion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  But at the same time, there are some champions in League of Legends that
  everyone enjoys playing. Whether they\u2019re ADCs, assassins, bruisers
  &#8211; these picks are widely popular in every elo of the <a
  href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/how-to-quickly-climb-the-league-of-legends-rank-ladder\/\"
  data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8671\">ranked ladder<\/a>. They\u2019re often
  picked despite the obvious counter picks, and they also have some of the most
  \u201cmain\u201d players in numbers. So no matter if you\u2019re watching a
  challenger or a silver game, chances are that you\u2019re probably going to
  spot one of these champions there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  And of course, not a single champion in LoL can be universally loved by
  literally everyone since no one likes losing. But if there are champions that
  come close to that, then those are these 5!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

      You might see it as a joke, but Thresh is the go-to pick for every player
      on the planet that gets auto-filled in the support role. And yes, it is a
      very difficult champion that demands a lot of <a
      href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/lol-mastery-a-complete-guide\/\"
      data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9375\">mastery<\/a>, but he is undeniably fun
      to play too! All of his abilities neatly tie together, and when you line
      them up perfectly &#8211; there is rarely a more satisfying feeling in
      League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Thresh\u2019s Q &#8211; Death Sentence is one of the hardest abilities to
      hit, but the challenging part is what makes us keep trying. It has
      inspired so many god-like moments in esports. And all those mad
      predictions make Thresh such an interesting champion to maneuver. And his
      W &#8211; Dark Passage is quite a story for its own. Even though Thresh
      has been around for more than 7 seasons, the lantern has stayed as perhaps
      the most one-of-a-kind mechanic in League of Legends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

          Jhin has already been elected by the LoL community to be the
          best-designed champion in the entire game. And you won\u2019t find
          that surprising after you play him even once!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Jhin is a contradictory character to his role. Most marksmen champions
          tend to go for a heavy attack speed and kiting, Jhin favors precision
          and aiming. He is the perfect middle ground between a traditional ADC
          champion and a MID pick, which makes him, really\u2026 perfect! His Q
          and E help him lend a long-range root through his W, and his ultimate
          is never-repeated one until now!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          But LoL players also like Jhin because of his personality. His <a

          are both philosophical and fun. And for some reason, we love playing
          with this mad killer type of maniac and just smile satisfyingly every
          time he finishes his count to 4!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              Yes, it\u2019s true, Yasuo is also among the most hated champions
              in League of Legends, right besides Teemo. But everyone can admit
              that when playing him, Yasuo is tons of fun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              The dash-and-strike playstyle is a very engaging mechanic that
              forces you to pay attention while playing and not just go on
              auto-pilot. During the laning phase, Yasuo has many tools to
              outsmart his opponent, primarily with his W &#8211; Wind Wall. And
              when his Q &#8211; Steel Tempest turns into a tornado, it\u2019s
              always a go time!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Yasuo\u2019s ultimate &#8211; Last Breath can be an excellent
              ability for both team fights and 1v1 duels. There are tons of
              tricks that go with it, like the Flash + E + Q, and also
              performing an auto-attack before pressing the R button while
              enemies are still airborne for maximum damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Yasuo has one of the highest skill caps in League of Legends, and
              that\u2019s why people hate him initially. When players who
              can\u2019t quite meet his criteria usually fail and feed. But when
              Yasuo is in a pro\u2019s hands, he shines the
              brightest!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                  Ezreal is perhaps the most likable character in League of
                  Legends. All of his abilities are skill shots that need to be
                  aimed at, and there is no reason for anyone to not love him.
                  When playing Ezreal, you\u2019re both an ADC and a mage, and
                  continuously shooting Mystic Shots makes for such compelling
                  gameplay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  And not only does Ezreal\u2019s playstyle is very
                  \u201cactive\u201d, but the aesthetics of his spells are also
                  stunning. The animations are pretty cool, and all of his skins
                  (there a lot of them) gorgeous to look at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ezreal\u2019s also a very unique champion in the sense that he
                  is pretty much limitless. You can randomly select any rune for
                  a keystone and any build path, and you will still deal
                  unbelievable amounts of damage! Ezreal works great in both the
                  AD and AP departments, and he can do pretty much everything!
                  Plus, his quotes are very assuring of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                      Every single player that has ever played League of Legends
                      has at least tried out Lee Sin. What can be more fun than
                      a flying kung-fu monk that can kick enemies left and right
                      and decimate them with punches and kicks? Yep,
                      nothing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Lee is a global phenomenon in League of Legends because,
                      like Ezreal, he can do everything really. He is good at
                      one-shotting, he is good at supporting, he is good as a
                      utility\/engage tool\u2026 he is good for all types of
                      situations in the game. By now, there have been more than
                      a hundred different builds for Lee Sin, both tanky and
                      bruiser ones, and they have all worked excellently on
                      him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      And, Lee Sin\u2019s R &#8211; Dragon\u2019s Rage is one of
                      the rarest abilities in League of Legends because every
                      season, people find another way to perform it. First, it
                      started with the inSec kick, then it transitioned to the
                      Flash kick, and who knows what will be next. No matter how
                      much you\u2019ve played Lee Sin, it seems like every new
                      game, there is something new for you to
                      learn!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          With such a broad choice of champions in League of
                          Legends, it\u2019s not surprising that many
                          didn\u2019t make this list. Akali, Vayne, Zed, and
                          many others are also heavily prioritized by most of

                          How do we measure which champions are the most fun to
                          play in League of Legends? When the game is over 10
                          years old, and the champion pool is larger than 150,
                          it\u2019s tough to find just a few shining examples.
                          That\u2019s because, in League, there are characters
                          of all styles. By now, we\u2019ve seen
