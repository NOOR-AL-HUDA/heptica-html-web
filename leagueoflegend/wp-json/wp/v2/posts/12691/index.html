<p>
  On one level, gaming is all about being whatever and whoever you want to be.
  And League of Legends features over a hundred champions to play with and
  thousands of possible team combinations. Gamers tend to have a gamer-tag when
  they play various roles in so many different games. Double-lift and Faker are
  known for their gamer tags instead of their real names. For League,
  let&#8217;s just refer to gamer tags as Summoner names.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

<p>
  So what are some of the ways you can create cool special characters in League
  of Legends?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

          You can simply go to the website LoL names (<a
          href=\"http:\/\/lolnames.gg\">lolnames.gg<\/a>) and check whether or
          not you Summoner name you are thinking of is available in the server
          you want to play in. Before choosing Special characters in League of
          Legends, it&#8217;s important to first assess the possibility of
          creating such special characters in the first place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          You can simply choose the server from the drop-down menu and check the
          availability of the summoner name you want to adopt. The interesting
          thing about this name checker website is that it will never tell you
          the summoner name you are proposing is not available. It will always
          indicate the time when the summoner name is available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          When you know the availability of the summoner name, a button will
          appear on the screen which says &#8220;Add special characters&#8221;.
          Click on that button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          A new Tab will open on the browser window. A range of options will now
          be available on-screen showing the possible special characters
          available with the proposed Summoner name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, while researching for this piece, the Summoner name
          &#8220;sadsa&#8221; was tried. The result is screen-shoted below.
          Notice the &#8220;Add special characters&#8221; button.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          The available special characters with respect to the Summoner name
          &#8220;sadsa&#8221; will appear in the next Tab as shown
          below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally speaking, the following list of all uppercase and lowercase
          special characters are allowed in League of Legends summoner names.
          They look similar to English letters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
