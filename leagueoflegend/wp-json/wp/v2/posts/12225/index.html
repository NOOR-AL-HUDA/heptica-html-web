      tournaments hand in hand<a

      set to grow even further as the company announced that it&#8217;s going to
      be opening a brand-new studio in Shanghai, China.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
      <h2>
        <strong
          >The Rise of Riot Games<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n
          <p>
            In 2006, Riot Games was created by two university friends who had a
            common love for video games and a passion for creating a game with
            longevity. Disillusioned by developers that release game after game,
            they believed games worked best if they were released for free and
            <a
            href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/5-ways-riot-can-improve-high-elo-solo-queue\/\">had
            updates, patches<\/a>, perks, levels, and much more that came at a
            later date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
          </p>
          <p>
            It was something that would give the game longevity and inspire a
            loyal fan base. And in 2009, along came
            <em
              >League of Legends<\/em>, a free-to-play game that is now known by
              millions across the globe. It&#8217;s become a game that listens
              to its players, becoming more of a gaming community rather than
              something you&#8217;d just sit down and play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
              <p>
                Often, gaming developers would listen to players and note their
                feedback to incorporate it into the next release. As the company
                grew and expanded its offices across the world, the game&#8217;s
                popularity grew as well. Not just with people playing, but with
                people watching, and this saw Riot Games move into the eSports
                arena, holding its own tournaments and championships. Now, with
                a move into the Far East, things are going to get even
                better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                        Okay, so for those of us who keep up to date with
                        what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, we already know
                        that Tencent, a Chinese gaming giant, owns riot Games.
                        And yes, there are those of us who might question how
                        much influence Chinese companies have on Riot Games. But
                        there&#8217;s been a lot of reassurance that Tencent
                        acts as the publisher, letting Riot Games operate on its
                        own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        This isn&#8217;t anything to be concerned about because
                        when you look at how long Tencent has been in control
                        (since 2011), they&#8217;ve let Riot Games continue as
                        they have. All this means is that it will be easier to
                        expand into the Chinese market and leverage the
                        opportunities there \u2013 provided the <a

                      <p>
                        The new studio is set to open in Shanghai, focusing on
                        creating new games for players on a global scale.
                        It&#8217;ll also be good for the economy, with hundreds
                        of roles being made available for games developers and
                        designers in China. It&#8217;s also a good time for this
                        move to happen as PC gaming is hugely popular in China,
                        making more than 32% of game revenue and accounts for
                        almost 45% of gamers. With so many passionate players in

                                    globally, including the League of Legends

                                        estimated to generate over $1 billion in
                                        revenue, with the majority of that sum
