  League of Legends is all about teamwork. If one of your teammates happens to
  be <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"

  your team coordination is weak, it\u2019s likely the opponent team will be
  able to pick your teammates one by one. Any single champion that is too fed in
  any team can only go so far without a team to back him or her up. And the key
  to winning team fights and battles is crowd control or <a

  data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer

  balanced combination of mage\/tank and engage enemies with at least one
  champion with cc to win team fights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

<p>
  What exactly is crowd control, by the way? Riot won\u2019t give you an
  official definition but what cc means roughly is the ability to control or
  limit the movement of your opponent\u2019s champions or disable or reduce the
  effects of their powers during team fights or in individual battles as well.
  Let\u2019s take a look at the most extended and also the most annoying (from

      The longer the Arrow travels, the longer the stun. Simple enough? It can
      stun multiple enemies as well if they are unlucky enough to be in the way
      of Ashe\u2019s ultimate. In team fights, this can turn the tide of battle
      in one stroke. You just need to make sure Ashe in your team is hidden from
      enemy sight and at a safe distance to allow the Arrow to travel a long
      distance to result in a long stun. If done right, opponents can get
      stunned by up to 4 seconds, possibly more. In a high-stakes 5v5 team
      battle, even a lapse of one second can prove to be fatal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

          Morgana\u2019s Q can feel like an eternity if you get hit by it. Even
          at level 3, Dark Binding damages and roots enemies to one spot in
          early bot-lane, exposing them to all sorts of damage. Combine any AD
          carry with burst damage with Morgana, and you have a lethal
          combination. You just need to hit the enemy AD carry with
          Morgana\u2019s Q and have your AD carry do the burst damage. If it
          doesn\u2019t give you a kill, it will indeed serve to discourage the
          opponent bot lane from attacking you in the street. Dark Binding can
          last nearly two seconds when fully maxed. Two seconds of not being
          able to move in a fast-paced game of League of Legends can be
          torment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                    Veigar can be included in this list because his cc abilities
                    can feel like the longest. If you get caught in the Event
                    Horizon and manage to get stunned by hitting the wall, you
                    are in the perfect spot for Veigar to do maximum damage to
                    you. With the opponent boxed in by using Event Horizon,
                    Veigar can cast Baleful Strike, Dark Matter, and Primordial
                    Burst. Couple Veigar as support with an AD Carry such as
                    Miss Fortune, and you can double the fun. Try using
                    Veigar\u2019s Event Horizon and Miss Fortune\u2019s Make it
                    Rain and Bullet Time together. The opponents won\u2019t have
                    much breathing space left.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                        Amumu is excellent at starting team fights and stunning
                        the entire enemy team. His CC is one of the longest in
                        the game because virtually all of his abilities help
                        crowd control. Amumu\u2019s Bandage Toss stuns opponents
                        as he latches onto them. This also allows Amumu to pull
                        into position before using his ultimate. His Despair and
                        Tantrum help harass enemies if they try to attack Amumu
                        by coming close to him. And finally, Amumu\u2019s
                        ultimate, the Curse of the Sad Mummy, entangles
                        surrounding enemies in Bandages and stuns them. With
                        this series of abilities that Amumu has, it is easily
                        one of the longest ccs any champion can inflict on the
                        opponent\u2019s team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                  If used correctly, Illiao\u2019s tentacles can
                                  be a very effective method for crowd control.
                                  With multiple tentacles spread around in the
                                  laning phase or during team fights, it can
                                  steer the direction of the battle in your
                                  favor. Opponents will either have to retreat
                                  out of the range of tentacles or try to endure
                                  during the fight, which automatically gives
                                  you an edge. With Iliaoi\u2019s Test of
                                  Spirit, you can pull out the spirit from the
                                  squishy damage dealer in the opponent\u2019s
                                  team resulting in that champion backing off
                                  from the team fight. With the damage dealer
                                  out of the way, the coast is clear for your
                                  team to push forward and dominate team
