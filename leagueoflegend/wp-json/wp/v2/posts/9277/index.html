Best Roaming Mid Laners in Season 11"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  In the current League of Legends meta, you cannot turn away from roaming. It
  is vital throughout every single role, mainly <a
  href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/5-best-off-meta-mid-laners-in-season-10\/\"
  data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9071\">mid lane<\/a>. Instead of remaining in the
  lane to be the farmer you\u2019ve always wanted to be, roaming and assisting
  your teammates can significantly impact the match. Some champions can easily
  complete this type of task because they have higher versatility and
  mobility.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

    <p>
      Nocturne really is the Eternal Nightmare, and you\u2019ll see why. In
      League of Legends, you all know how important vision is, right? By knowing
      your enemy\u2019s moves, you can deploy your playstyle with confidence.
      The higher rank you are, the more important vision control is going to be.
      When Nocturne activates his R (Paranoia), all control wards and Warding
      Totems will be deemed useless.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of going for a full-<a
      href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/lethality-league-of-legends-how-does-it-work-updated-2020\/\"
      data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7321\">lethality<\/a> build, Nocturne is
      effective simply by sticking with semi-damage items. Now, Nocturne is more
      known as a Jungler and not so much as a mid or top lane. However, in
      recent seasons, we noticed that LoL players started to choose this
      champion more as a solo laner because of his ability to quickly clear
      those minions using his Q (Duskbringer) and the passive from W (Shroud of
      Darkness). The passive also helps Nocturne a bit with healing when
      combines with W.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      By soloing on this Champion, Nocturne will be able to maximize his
      experience and quickly get to level 6, and then from there, he will make
      sure he gives nightmares to the enemy team.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      For those less mobile and fragile champions, Nocturne is one big
      nightmare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      During the early game, try to clear those minions as fast as you can
      \u2013 you can use your Q (Duskbringer) to do this \u2013 this will help
      you quickly reach level 6. In order to maximize the pushing ability of
      Nocturne, we recommend building Tiamat early in the
      game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have reached your ultimate <a
      href=\"https:\/\/euw.leagueoflegends.com\/en-gb\/champions\/nocturne\/\">Paranoia<\/a>,
      set up a sudden attack. This will send the enemies into major panic,
      disabling any chance they may have had of getting a back-up teleport from
      their team members. With the large amount of damage combined with his CC
      effect from Unspeakable Horror (E), this champion can take down the weak
      prey.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      With Nocturne, it is important to realize he isn\u2019t going to be a
      strong champion in the late game, so you\u2019ll want to try to finish the
      match as soon as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

      <strong
        >Tips when Playing on Nocturne:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n
        <ul>
          <li>
            Nocturne\u2019s Intrinsic attack is a lot like Renekton\u2019s Q.
            The more targets this attack hits, the more you\u2019re going to
            heal, so you\u2019ll want to try to strike as many targets as you
            can.&nbsp;<\/li>
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to get a large bonus amount of AD and Movement Speed,
            you\u2019ll want to pay attention to the dark trail created by your
            Q (Duskbringer).&nbsp;<\/li>
          </li>
          <li>
            When Nocturne blocks an enemy\u2019s skill using W, his attack speed
            will be doubled.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n

                  When thinking about a champion with the most terrifying
                  ability damage in LoL, Talon always comes to mind. As soon as
                  Talon reaches level 2 and unlocks two skills, W (Rake) and Q
                  (Noxus Diplomacy), he isn\u2019t going to have any problems
                  eliminating a large portion of the enemy\u2019s HP if they are
                  a <a
                  href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol\/\"

                  champion<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  A good combo that activates Passive (Blade\u2019s End)
                  combined with Ignite can help Talon get his First Blood. Even
                  if Talon isn\u2019t able to solo kill the enemy champion, he
                  can continuously drain their health, making it so that they
                  really cannot do anything besides hold still in their lane
                  &#8211; this allows Talon to take advantage of the other
                  lanes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Talon has a special ability that boosts his ability to roam
                  and helps Talon show up where the enemy team would never
                  expect him to be \u2013 the E (Assassin\u2019s
                  Path).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you choose Talon as your champion, you will want to
                  purchase Tiamat so that you can maximize his ability to push.
                  This will make it easier to roam the map and eliminate those
                  weak targets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Talons Assasin Path (E) makes it so that he can cross through
                  artificial terrains such as Anivia\u2019s W or Trundle\u2019s
                  E.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                      <li>
                        You want to avoid overdoing E because it has a separate
                        cooldown on each wall, and you may need to use them
                        later to getaway.&nbsp;<\/li>

                      <li>
                        Talons Darkness (W) has a certain delay, but you can use
                        your Flash or Q to change direction \u2013 similar to
                        Ahri\u2019s Q.&nbsp;<\/li>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Combo 2 W + Q + basic attack will give Talon his maximum
                        passive.<\/li>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Noxian Diplomacy (Q) will regenerate Talon\u2019s basic
                        attacks. If you\u2019re quick at what you\u2019re doing,
                        you\u2019ll be able to add a normal attack on Q\u2019s
                        flight path, so if you hit the target, the champion will
                        auto-attack without clicking.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n

                              During a team fight, with your point-to-face skill
                              set, try targeting the enemy\u2019s ADCs. This
                              champion will become weaker by the late game
                              because his enemy\u2019s will more than likely
                              have more defensive items. This means that Patheon
                              won\u2019t be as strong as he was in the beginning
                              or mid-game when he had his full-damage items. So,
                              if you choose Pantheon as your champion, you will
                              need to finish the game as fast as you

                                    You\u2019ll want to pay attention to
                                    Patheon\u2019s passive (Battle of Attitude).
                                    You can use this to strengthen your next
                                    skill. If you want to put a large amount of
                                    damage on your enemy\u2019s, you should
                                    strengthen Q or W \u2013 W will give this
                                    champion three more attacks, while Q will
                                    increase the damage and slow. If you want to
                                    escape from ganks or increase your chance of
                                    getting a kill, enhance E.<\/li>

                                    you can use it to create pressure on your
                                    opponents and farm minions. Save E (Attack
                                    of the Storm) because this skill has a slow
                                    cooldown during the game&#8217;s early

                                          Last on our list; we have Pyke. Now,
                                          this is a pretty unique support
                                          champion in League of Legends. This
                                          champion isn\u2019t like the other
                                          champions we talked about. This one
                                          has a weak laning phase because of the
                                          continuous nerfs from Riot. With his Q
                                          and E no longer dealing damage to the
                                          minions. He doesn\u2019t have a whole
                                          lot of tools to use in order to clear
                                          the minions. However, this
                                          doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a horrible
                                          champion; he\u2019s actually quite
                                          useful if you take the time to know
                                          him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                        <p>
                                          Don\u2019t let those weaknesses fool
                                          you, because Pyke has a good recovery
                                          ability from Gift of the Drowned Ones
                                          (passive), and thanks to Phantom
                                          Undertow (E), his anti-ganking ability
                                          is great.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                          Once you pass the laning phase on this
                                          champion, he will turn into a real
                                          killer because of his ability to
                                          \u201cscoop\u201d and maneuver. Death
                                          from Below will help Pyke instantly
                                          kill the enemy target once it reaches
                                          a certain HP
                                          threshold.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                          Pyke\u2019s combos are difficult to
                                          master, but once you do, you\u2019ll
                                          be happy with this champion. If
                                          you\u2019re using him for solo-laning,
                                          you\u2019ll want to keep up with your
                                          opponent&#8217;s amount of minions and
                                          level. Early on, jump on the Boots of
                                          Mobility and Tiamat so that you can
                                          roam other lanes and support your
                                          teammates. In the mid and late game,
                                          try not to go solo because Pyke is
                                          stronger with a

                                                when there\u2019s no enemy
