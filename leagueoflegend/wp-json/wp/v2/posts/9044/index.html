<p>
  In the year 2021, the word &#8216;toxicity&#8217; can be used to describe a
  ton of different things. People, environments, actions, and more can be hit
  with that bleak title, and suddenly it&#8217;s a beacon to let others know of
  the festering negativity you can expect from<strong

        To someone who doesn&#8217;t have a background in video games, then the
        correlation between toxic and players may be missing. Luckily, Urban
        Dictionary pretty much has us covered. On their site, they define
        &#8220;<a

              <p>
                When it comes to a game like League, toxic behavior has always
                been prevalent within its player base for as long as I can
                remember. When I started my battle for the Rift in 2016, one of
                the greatest pieces of advice my friend Mirage gave me was to
                disable \/all chat. One day my curiosity got the best of me.
                Unfortunately, my feeble little mind couldn&#8217;t handle the
                level of flame ignited under me because of my less than
                satisfactory play. <\/p>\n\n\n\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Before I knew it, I was typing back. A visceral response was
                felt in me to defend myself because the person who flamed me
                was, by all accounts, doing worse than myself. A grand effort on
                my part, surely, to explain the logistics of why that team fight
                didn&#8217;t work; to explain what went wrong and how to correct
                it fell on deaf ears. We ff&#8217;d, and I was left with a sour
                taste in my mouth that left me feeling on edge for my next
                blind.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure

                    So, what happened? Well, for starters, toxicity can derive
                    from two places. The first place comes from a feeling of
                    superiority, while the other comes from a feeling of
                    inferiority like my example from above. Superiority is
                    relatively easy to explain.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you&#8217;re doing well, exceptionally so or otherwise,
                    you may feel the need to have a bit of banter or
                    &#8220;trash talk&#8221; your opponent. On the other end of
                    the spectrum, you will see toxicity stemming from a feeling
                    of inferiority. If a person is less than happy with how
                    their team or themselves are doing against an enemy team,
                    they&#8217;re more likely to insult and belittle their
                    teammates. But how do you deal with it if it&#8217;s
                    directed towards you? How do you ensure that you don&#8217;t
                    fall into the trap of initiating or responding to
                    flame?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                    According to an article posted on&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer

                    team&#8217;s morale and make it&nbsp;<strong

                                Although it lowers morale, some people would
                                argue that toxicity is now an ingrained part of
                                the game itself. League does not do a good job
                                in the tutorial phase of teaching players how to
                                play well, but the main question

                                  experience. The ability to identify the win
                                  condition within the game comes from learning
                                  retention. League is as complex as it is
                                  toxic, and the best way for new players to
                                  learn will be from other
