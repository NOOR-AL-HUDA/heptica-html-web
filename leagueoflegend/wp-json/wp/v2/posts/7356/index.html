<h2>
  Zoe &#8211; The Aspect of Twilight<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image

  <p>
    This one-shotting monstrosity has been ruining games ever since she was
    released. She has been so annoying that a group of &#8220;Zoe Haters&#8221;
    even created a petition on change.org to remove Zoe from League of Legends
    and had gotten over 50,000 signatures on it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n
  </p>
  <p>
    Even after many changes, a good Zoe can single-handedly change the game
    around with her Drowsy out of nowhere and max range Q to one-shot
    enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
  </p>
  <h2>
    Yasuo &#8211; The Unforgiven<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure

    alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n
    <p>
      Yes, Yasuo is unforgiven because of how the champ is. You can never trust
      a Yasuo especially if he is a <a
      href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/lol-mastery-a-complete-guide\/\"
      data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9375\">Mastery<\/a> Level 7 Yasuo as almost
      all Yasuo players play around their 0\/10 power spike. No Yasuo player is
      consistent, and in 9 out of 10 games, the Yasuo will always be a feeder.
      <\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      He is also one of the most Popular champions because of his
      &#8220;cool&#8221; aspect but also a very high-risk champion. Him being
      popular just increases his play rate and thus the number of feeders in
      your games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <h2>
      Qiyana &#8211; Empress of the Elements<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure
      class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img
      src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zQLJouo.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n
      <p>
        Qiyana is such a popular champion that she got a Prestige skin shortly
        after her release! <br />Being an extremely \u201cbadass\u201d champion
        at Worlds 2019, Qiyana was seemed to be continuously nerfed but in fact,
        the Elemental Queen become a powerhouse in Pre-Season 2020. Qiyana takes
        advantage of the map\u2019s new changes too well when she can easily
        roam thanks to the acceleration area of Could Drake, more dust from the
        Ocean Drake enable her mobility increasingly, especially the Ultimate
        Supreme Display of Talent that makes good use of the walls in the
        Mountain Drake\u2019s Map.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Being an Assassin, Qiyana takes a lot of benefits from terrains, not
        only her mobility but also having a large stun skill by (R), indeed
        Qiyana possesses too many privileges. Even the ultimate\u2019s ability
        to deal damage and stun is too large and is so easy to use on most
        terrains of the Summoner\u2019s Rift map makes this skill almost always
        stunned opponents, help her can easily perform a basic combo that is
        enough to one-shot the enemies that they could not react in time.
        Because of this, there has been a wave of support for the removal of
        Qiyana from League of Legends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

      <h2>
        Yuumi &#8211; The Magical Cat<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure
        class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img
        src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/aiTPPW8.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n
        <p>
          Yes, <a
          href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/more-hated-than-teemo-yummi-has-incredibly-high-ban-rate-on-eu-servers\/\"
          data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7007\">Yuumi<\/a> also has a huge wave of
          supporters wanting to remove her from League of Legends because of how
          the champion is. All you need to do is stick to someone and press E
          and R for a win. This champion requires 0 skill as she doesn&#8217;t
          even need to dodge abilities or even right-click to move. You could
          program a robot to press E and R after certain intervals and you would
          still win the game! she is that broken and that annoying.<br /><\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, Yuumi is a pretty good idea of \u200b\u200bRiot Games with
          the \u201csticking\u201d mechanism that is both special and suitable
          for the shape of a \u201ccat\u201d. However, due to the somewhat lazy
          gameplay, Yuumi is not very attractive to players. The fact that this
          cat is completely dependent on the ADC, whom you cling to, also makes
          her too strong in the solo queue. <\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <h2>
          Teemo<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img
          src=\"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rZrv2Y0.jpg\"
          alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n
          <p>
            Teemo is that one champion who is fun when you play him, but you
            absolutely hate him when you&#8217;re playing against him. Have you
            ever got killed by stepping on a shroom in your own jungle? If you
            did, then you know why he&#8217;s on this list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
