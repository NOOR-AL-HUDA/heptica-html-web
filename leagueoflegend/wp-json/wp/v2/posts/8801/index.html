  This post right here is inspired by a friend \u2013 the other day, in chat, he
  told me that his League of Legends game was running slow, and he
  couldn&#8217;t figure out what was wrong with it. When we asked him to take a
  look at his hard drive space, he said the storage that holds LoL is
  full\u2026well, that right there is the problem. While League of Legends is a
  great game, if the disc space is running low, like other games out there, it
  will run slow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  After some research, we discovered that our friend isn&#8217;t the only one
  that didn&#8217;t know about this, so we&#8217;d like to get the word out
  there. Also, we will give you three methods of moving League of Legends to
  another drive (this way, your game will no longer run
  slow).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  You can form a current folder for Steam plays, but you need to follow the
  right techniques to get things right. In this post, we&#8217;re going to
  introduce you to numerous ways to get that LoL data to a new HD. If
  you&#8217;ve never done this, you may be getting a headache right now, but
  take it from us, it isn&#8217;t as complicated as you may think. Before you
  know it, you&#8217;ll be back in a match fighting your way to the
  Nexus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

        League of Legends is an exciting game to play, which is why so many
        people are playing it. On a daily bases, <a

        has a total of 27 million players logging in. Monthly, they have more
        than 110 million players \u2026out of those 110 million players; we
        could only wonder how many are having issues with the game simply
        because their hard drive is maxed. When the game starts to run slow,
        this is never a good feeling, regardless of who you are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are one of those 67 million players, and you notice something is
        off about the game, then you may want to transfer your data to a
        separate location so that it will run smoothly. If necessary, configure
        your folder and in-game settings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
