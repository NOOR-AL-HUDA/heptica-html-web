7 Best Bruisers in League of Legends"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  Playing Champions that are only good at one thing is often not that
  interesting. It\u2019s boring to walk around soaking in damage as a Tank and
  dealing it as some plain DPS.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  But what if I told you that you could do both and do it
  well?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  Welcome to Bruisers (also known as Fighters). A class of Champions that both
  tanks like hell AND does a lot of damage. This class is one of the more
  versatile in the game, making for an enjoyable experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  In this list, I compiled the 7 Best Bruisers in League of Legends based on how
  well they perform in the lane and how good their late game
  is.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

  Prepare to have your head bashed in by heavy objects as we start our
  list.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

      Everyone loves League\u2019s best Spartan. A mighty, mobile spear-wielding
      warrior is an excellent pick for players who love to maintain
      distance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      His Q has an insane range that you can snipe with safely from the other
      side of the lane. His E is a fantastic damage-soaking spell, and with
      proper utilization, you can win trades with barely any
      effort.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

      down so you can stab them to death. If they somehow manage to retreat
      under the tower, your Ultimate \u2013
      <strong
        >Grand Starfall <\/strong>\u2013 will help you jump on their head from
        massive range.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n

          Pantheon has all he needs for a top lane bruiser but also a <a

        </p>
        <p>
          He shines in the early to mid-game but remains viable in the late game
          as a solid initiator that can block damage, apply valuable CC, and
          finish off that pesky ADC that has too many escape
          abilities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

            <p>
              Mordekaiser is one of the best top lane champions, period. He has
              great damage, superb sustain, and can fight for
              days.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Every player that indulges in bruisers has played and loved, Morde
              at least once. His kit is super fun. I mean, who
              <em
                >doesn\u2019t <\/em>want to forcefully invite enemies into a
                duel to the death and steal their stats in the
                process?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                <p>
                  In the early game, you can control the lane and apply heavy
                  pressure on your opponent. Zoning is a no-brainer as they will
                  barely be able to get near you. Of course, some Champions will
                  outperform you eventually, but that is rarely the case if
                  played correctly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mordekaiser is a crucial element in the late game. His
                  Ultimate \u2013
                  <strong
                    >Realm of Death<\/strong> \u2013 is the sole
                    <strong
                      >best<\/strong> isolation spell in the game. You can take
                      out any vital target from the fight (along, of course,
                      with yourself). This can help your team swipe up the
                      enemies and win the game altogether.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                Our second diver on this list, and certainly not
                                the last, is the bloodthirsty werewolf everyone
                                hates to see. Warwick is capable of many things,
                                but what he excels at are lockdowns and heals.
                                Lots and lots of heals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Primarily found in the jungle, he is an annoying
                                ganker. He can fear you and stun you with his E
                                and R while he rips you to shreds and runs you
                                down with his W. His basic attacks are buffed by
                                a ton by his passive, making him one of the
                                heaviest hitters among the bruiser
                                class.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                Everything in his kit has some sort of
                                vamp\/lifesteal about it. His passive heals him
                                when he\u2019s below 50%; his Q heals him for a
                                portion of damage dealt, his R heals him for its
                                entire damage done, etc. Due to this, he can be
                                hard to kill as he can run away with his high
                                movement speed and come back just as fast, fully
                                healed up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
