  Here\u2019s the scenario \u2013 you\u2019re having the time of your life
  playing League of Legends, you\u2019re comfortable, and everything\u2019s
  going right\u2026 then all of a sudden, you run into an assassin that brings
  out the frustration from deep inside of you, the frustration you didn\u2019t
  even know you had. That annoying Assassin keeps one-shotting you, and you
  can\u2019t seem to figure it out. Well, we\u2019re going to shed a little
  light on your situation and help you understand how you got
  one-shotted.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

<p>Hint: It involved Lethality!<\/p>\n\n\n\n</p>

    <p>
      Back in Season 7, League of Legends introduced a new statistic. This is a
      change that was made in order to replace the flat armor penetration.
      Basically, you\u2019re granted flat armor penetration using this
      formula:<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Flat Armor Penetration = LETHALITY x (0.6 + 0.4 x level %
          18)<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n
          <p>
            During Season 7, flat armor penetration was changed and transformed
            into the new Lethality stats. Yes, they changed the name, and this
            was to clear up any confusion the LoL community may have. The
            previous name was \u201cflat armor penetration,\u201d and this
            suggested that it was good when going against targets with
            armor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
          </p>
          <p>
            It is worth noting that some items are better on certain champions
            than on others. Take ability power as an example \u2013 this is used
            for wizards, armor, magic resistance on tanks, physical damage for
            those damage carriers, and assassins.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
          </p>
          <p>
            <a
            href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/ardentunited\/league-of-lethality-e9e14a8e196d\">Lethality
            originated in 2017<\/a> and is converted into fixed armor
            penetration. In LoL, there are actually four different types of
            calculations to reduce or penetrate the enemy\u2019s armor:
            percentage armor reduction, fixed armor reduction, armor
            penetration, and Lethality. Don&#8217;t worry; we&#8217;ll explain
            each of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
          </p>
          <h2>
            <strong
              >Fixed Armor Reduction<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n
              <p>
                Under fixed armor reduction, the enemy\u2019s armor can be
                reduced by a fixed amount. This reduction will cause the loss of
                an enemy\u2019s temp armor. If the enemy has 20 armor, and you
                reduce 20, then this will leave your opponent standing there
                naked, with 0 armor. Fixed <a

                reduction<\/a> can exceed zero, which makes the attribute
                negative, increasing your damage even more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
              </p>
              <h2>
                <strong
                  >Percentage Armor Reduction<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n
                  <p>
                    When you have a target hit by skill or an item that reduces
                    the armor by a certain percentage, physical damage will be
                    even more effective.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Take the Black Cleaver as an example; it has what we refer
                    to as a \u201cSlit\u201d effect \u2013 this can reduce the
                    enemy champions&#8217; armor by up to 24% (ouch). If the
                    enemy champion has 100 armor, he\/she will lose 24 and keep
                    76.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                  </p>

                          >Current armor = total \u2013 (percentage) = 100
                          \u2013 (100 x 24\/100) = 100 \u2013 24 =
                          76<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          <h2>

                              <p>
                                Unlike percentage armor reduction and fixed
                                armor reduction, armor penetration is only
                                guaranteed to the champion who applies it. The
                                opponent\u2019s resistance isn\u2019t going to
                                be reduced gradually or steadily for all
                                physical damage, but only for the champion
                                himself. This is an attribute used in damage
                                carriers and is best applied when going against
                                targets with a large amount of
                                armor.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                resistance, this is going to result in

                                            Lethality ignores a fixed value of
                                            the enemy champions armor, and it
                                            cannot exceed zero. This works as
