    >Viktor in ARAM in Season 12 &#8211; Strengths and
    Weaknesses<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n
    <p>
      Unlike in the past, Viktor is currently one of the <a
      href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/5-best-solo-queue-champions-in-league-of-legends\/\"
      data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8813\">best champions to dominate season
      <\/a>12, especially in ARAM. Riot Games have reworked his passive, and
      Viktor no longer requires an external item to boost his damage. All he
      needs is a\u00a0<strong
        >Luden\u2019s Tempest<\/strong>\u00a0to start one-shotting people left
        and right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        <p>
          Viktor isn\u2019t the <a
          href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/the-most-difficult-league-of-legends-champions\/\"
          data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8685\">hardest champion to master<\/a>,
          and after a couple of games, you\u2019re going to feel comfortable
          with him. He has an extremely useful kit that lets him do damage but
          also to survive prolonged fights. He runs fast, bursts often, and is
          overall an excellent team-oriented champion!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          The only negative side to playing Viktor is that he is an immobile
          champion. It can be very easy for him to fall into the enemy\u2019s
          hands or get overrun. So positioning smartly is a crucial part, as
          well as getting alternative mobility options from his
          build.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you\u2019re interested in playing Viktor in ARAM in season 12,
          then you\u2019ve come to the right place to get the best build
          possible! Here we will take a look at the rune choices, item paths,
          spells, and all the additional tips and tricks that you\u2019re going
          to need.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                <p>
                  In ARAM, Viktor goes best with&nbsp;<strong
                    >Flash&nbsp;<\/strong>and&nbsp;<strong
                      >Mark<\/strong>. Flash helps you with literally everything
                      and is a great offensive and defensive tool. And Mark
                      allows you to reach your targets since Viktor doesn\u2019t
                      have the biggest ability range.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      <p>
                        But, know that&nbsp;<strong
                          >Ghost<\/strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong
                            >Clarity<\/strong>&nbsp;are both viable options in
                            certain situations. If the enemy team has a lot of
                            tanks and you need to kite, then Ghost will be the
                            better choice. And if no one on your team has
                            Clarity, then the extra mana might prove necessary
                            for the early game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                There are usually more kills in ARAM games than
                                in Summoner Rift ones, which means that Dark

                                ARAM. We've explained why each of these runes is
                                the perfect choice for him, and we sincerely

                                        Since you\u2019re going to fight 99% of

                                        increases Viktor\u2019s burst potential.
                                        And with enough stacks, Viktor becomes
