  to find it out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  First of all, League of Legends has a competitive nature. Since you are
  supposed to <a

  data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8671\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer

  keep going to the high level, you might be allowed to play against the
  professional players. Sounds quite exciting, doesn\u2019t it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  As a student, you probably lack opportunities to have fun with your friends.

  of Legends<\/a>. This game gives you a great chance to create your own team
  and enjoy your free nights together with friends. What\u2019s more, LoL makes
  it easy to make new acquaintances. So maybe you\u2019ll meet nice pals while
  playing?<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  The next reason why a lot of people love League of Legends is its regular
  updates. Riot is working very hard to ensure that players have a great time,
  so that\u2019s why they are constantly throwing out new versions of the game.
  Hence, it\u2019s impossible to get bored with LoL, even if you are an old
  player.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  Now that you realize why League of Legends is a great way to entertain
  yourself, you are probably wondering how to play it without compromising your
  learning. Below, you can find some effective recommendations for
  that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

          According to some research, student gamers spend nearly 30% less time
          reading. They also devote 34% less time to their home assignments. As
          a result, their academic performance gets worse. Hence, it\u2019s
          important for young people to set up tight academic routines, where
          they play games only after completing all the necessary work. However,
          sometimes tasks may be too challenging to complete on your own. If you
          find your homework extremely complicated, you can <a

          target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">find case study writing
          service<\/a> or turn to an essay platform, where professional writers
          will help you with papers in any discipline. Anyway, no matter whether
          you work on your assignments on your own or ask for help, the most
          important thing is that everything must be finished before you start
          playing League of Legends.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              It\u2019s so easy to get absolutely absorbed with League of
              Legends and lose track of time. The game is so exciting that it
              makes you forget about everything, especially your studies. But
              you have some school responsibilities that must be fulfilled and
              it\u2019s essential to take them into account while planning your
              day. To manage your time effectively, set a timetable where you
              have all the necessary things scheduled. This way you will ensure
              that you don\u2019t miss your deadlines. Also, bear in mind that
              you might underestimate the time needed to complete your tasks, so
              add a few buffer hours for learning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                  Adolescents often play video games all night long. Some
                  studies show that approximately 24% of students love gaming
                  after 9 pm. However, this behavior is quite destructive as it
                  causes insomnia and harms mental health. Psychologists say
                  that people that have poor sleep habits struggle with daytime
                  sleepiness and fatigue. Their memory, concentration, and other
                  cognitive functions get significantly worse after playing
                  League of Legends at night. And of course, it affects their
                  learning outcomes in a very negative way. Therefore, you
                  should find the right time for gaming if you don\u2019t want
                  your grades to become lower. It would be better to spend a few
                  hours in front of the screen before or in between your
                  classes. This way, you can keep your productivity levels
                  high.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          exciting as living in a virtual world. In its turn,
                          this may lead to anxiety and depression. Such mental
                          states inevitably influence cognitive functioning and
                          academic performance. The study is impossible without
                          regular social contacts, so gamers may lack guidance

                          learning, you should spend more time in the company of
                          peers that share your academic goals and
