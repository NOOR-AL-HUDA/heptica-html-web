  champions<\/a> that\u2019s a nightmare to be playing against. This champion is
  a pure monster, he deals a lot of damage, he heals a lot, and he has an
  incredibly fast movement speed. If you pick a tanky champion, he\u2019ll just
  steal your stats and beat you down with his life steal. On the other hand, if
  you decide to pick a squishy champion, he\u2019ll just run and hunt you down.
  So, now you\u2019re probably asking yourself: \u201c<em
    >Well, how do I beat this unstoppable answer?! He seems
    invincible!<\/em>\u201d. Don\u2019t worry because I\u2019ll tell you all
    about his weaknesses and how to counter Trundle in this quick and
    easy-to-follow guide! But, before I do, let&#8217;s have a look at his
    abilities to give you a better understanding of what things you should avoid
    doing when you&#8217;re facing him in your ranked games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                        the enemy champion, and he heals for the
                                        amount of damage dealt. Trundle also
                                        steals a percentage of his target\u2019s

                                                      Camille is one of the
                                                      worst matchups for Trundle
                                                      because she\u2019s able to
                                                      deal massive amounts of
                                                      true damage, which hurts
                                                      Trundle really bad.
                                                      Camille overall does a
                                                      great job in beating
                                                      Trundle overall, but she
                                                      can outdamage her in short
                                                      trades in the early game
                                                      if he doesn\u2019t allow
                                                      Camille to get her 2nd
                                                      proc of Q. However, if you
                                                      do decide to pick Camille
                                                      against Trundle, be
                                                      careful when you\u2019re
                                                      using your wall dash, as
                                                      he can stop it with his
