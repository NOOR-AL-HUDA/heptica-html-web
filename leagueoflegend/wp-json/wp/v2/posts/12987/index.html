6 Best Supports for Vayne in Season 12"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  Vayne is a very unique ADC champion in League of Legends. Not only is she able
  to 1v9 games, but she&#8217;s also a difficult champion to master. Vayne
  doesn&#8217;t have any <a href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/aoe-damage\/\"
  data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10434\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
  noopener\">AoE ability<\/a>, and her playstyle mostly revolves around kiting
  the enemy with her tumbles. And although she&#8217;s powerful on her own, she
  does extremely well with a few supports in particular. So, who are the best
  supports for Vayne?<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  With so many champions able to fill the support role, it&#8217;s difficult to
  find the perfect one for Vayne. Yes, she typically requires a
  &#8220;supportive&#8221; support, someone who can get her through the laning
  phase, but that&#8217;s not always the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

  <strong
    >Generally, Vayne works best with enchanter supports such as Lulu, Soraka,
    and Yuumi, but she can also do really well with tank supports because they
    can <a

    supports for Vayne in League of Legends. All of these champions have a great
    level of synergy with Vayne&#8217;s kit, so they&#8217;re always a good
    choice.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n

              <strong
                >Taric<\/strong> may not be the most popular champion in League
                of Legends, but he&#8217;s damn good at supporting late game
                ADCs. Naturally, Vayne falls in this category, so this makes her
                and Taric a perfect pair.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                <p>
                  In season 12, Vayne has the best win rate with Taric. It
                  circles around 56-57%, which is one of the highest numbers you
                  can find among the bot lane synergies. In other words, Vayne
                  and Taric win way more than they lose in all servers and elos
                  of League of Legends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>

                      >Why is this the case?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      <p>
                        Well, Taric has a few tools that turn Vayne into a
                        monster marksman. For starters, Taric&#8217;s heal and
                        bonus armor allow Vayne to safely farm in the laning
                        phase. And thanks to it, she can quickly scale and reach
                        her power spikes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Additionally, Taric has a great stun mechanic. It can be
                        used as a counterplay in situations where enemies jump
                        on Vayne. It will allow Vayne to get away or gain enough
                        range to start hitting back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But Taric&#8217;s ultimate is what makes the biggest
                        difference here. His Cosmic Radiance is one of the best
                        abilities in the entire game. It turns Vayne
                        invulnerable, allowing her to damage their opponents
                        without losing HP. This is incredibly helpful in all
                        situations, especially in games against assassins or
                        fighters.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So, when should you play the Taric and Vayne combo.
                        Honestly, any matchup is good as long as you
                        aren&#8217;t particularly aggressive in the early game.
                        Taric doesn&#8217;t have too much damage, and
                        Vayne&#8217;s power depends on levels and gold. So,
                        it&#8217;s best to take it slowly and farm for the late
                        game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                              <p>
                                <strong
                                  >Soraka<\/strong> has a similar function when
                                  it comes to supporting Vayne. And the biggest
                                  reason why she and Vayne have such a high win
                                  rate together (around 56%) is that Soraka can
                                  keep Vayne alive all the way to the late
                                  game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                  <p>
                                    In other words, Soraka&#8217;s best asset is
                                    her heal. She&#8217;s able to continually
                                    top Vayne&#8217;s health in lane, making it
                                    almost impossible for their opponents to
                                    slay them. This is particularly handy in
                                    those aggressive matchups, such as Caitlyn,
                                    Brand, Leona, and Draven.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    However, Soraka isn&#8217;t just a heal bot
                                    in LoL. You can often see experienced
                                    players completely outplay their enemies on
                                    the champion. Soraka can silence champions
                                    and put them into a root. But she can also
                                    damage them and slow them down. All of these
                                    tools go well with Vayne&#8217;s playstyle,
                                    so you have to apply them too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    In team fights, the power of Soraka and
                                    Vayne is almost unmatched. This is because
                                    Soraka has nearly unlimited healing to
                                    support Vayne with. And unless you&#8217;re
                                    playing a very bursty assassin, you
                                    can&#8217;t really slay Vayne when Soraka is
                                    healing her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    Their endurance is further backed up by
                                    Soraka&#8217;s ultimate, Wish. This ability
                                    is an AoE heal that can single-handedly win
                                    a team fight. If used right after
                                    Soraka&#8217;s W, Astral Infusion, it can
                                    regain 60-70% of Vayne&#8217;s lost
                                    health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    And the best part about it is that Grevious
                                    Wounds no longer works against Wish.
                                    Soraka&#8217;s R heals the target no matter
                                    the Grevious Wound percentage. And this
                                    means that as long as Soraka has her
                                    ultimate ready, Vayne simply can&#8217;t
                                    die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    So, that&#8217;s why Soraka is one of the
                                    best supports for Vayne in League of
                                    Legends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                          champion, she&#8217;s also one of the
                                          most broken ones. Not too many
                                          champions can stay untargetable during
                                          the entire fight and still influence
                                          it in their favor. So, she and Vayne
                                          are a great pair when it comes to team
                                          fighting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                          <p>
                                            When you analyze Yuumi as a
                                            champion, you can see that she
                                            doesn&#8217;t go well with any
                                            champion either. But if her bot
                                            laner is weak, she can choose to
                                            attach herself to a carry ally.
                                            However, in this case, she
                                            doesn&#8217;t have to. Vayne is one
                                            of the strongest carries in League
                                            of Legends, no matter the
                                            sore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                            Yuumi can tilt players out of their
                                            minds simply by keeping her attached
                                            ally alive. It&#8217;s insane when
                                            you think about how much value she
                                            brings to the table while being
                                            nearly invincible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                            While attached to Vayne, Yuumi can
                                            use her ability to kit to slow their
                                            enemies down, so Vayne can chase
                                            them. She can also root their
                                            opponents, making it easier for
                                            Vayne to take them down. But most
                                            importantly, Yuumi can keep Vayne
                                            alive with her heal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                            single ability. And it&#8217;s
                                            incredibly useful to Vayne,
                                            especially in the early
                                            game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                            And the thing that many players
                                            forget about Yuumi is the fact that
                                            she grants up to 20% AD or AP to the
                                            champion she&#8217;s attached. For
                                            Vayne, this is very helpful because
                                            it amplifies her damage
                                            significantly in the late game. And
                                            that&#8217;s why her DPS is the
                                            highest when paired with
                                            Yuumi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
