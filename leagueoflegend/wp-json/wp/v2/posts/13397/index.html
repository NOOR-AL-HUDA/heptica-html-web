7 Best DPS Champions in League of Legends"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  Every Champion in League of Legends has damage, and it\u2019s a fundamental
  part of the gameplay system in Riot\u2019s world-famous MOBA. There are
  various types of damage in this game: AP, AD, Burst, etc. This article will go
  over Champions that deal damage peculiarly \u2013 per second. This term is
  used to describe the damage done over a longer period.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

  I\u2019ve spoken in more detail about DPS in our

    Legends<\/a> <\/strong>article, so check it out to better understand this
    list.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    <p>
      This list is a compilation of Champions that I perceive to have the
      highest DPS in the game currently. As with any other list, keep in mind
      that it is not definitive, and there is plenty of Champions to choose from
      to satisfy your DPS needs\/&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

      Without further ado, let\u2019s begin with our list.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

        <p>
          Kog\u2019Maw is an infamous example of fast damage. As a hybrid
          marksman\/ADC, he can rain down his toxic DPS from a good distance.
          His attack speed, especially if he takes Lethal Tempo, is notoriously
          known to go up to around 5.0, which is twice as fast as the usual
          League cap.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Kog\u2019Maw shares similarities with Kai\u2019Sa in terms of how
          their auto-attacks perform. Due to his more simple nature, I\u2019ve
          put him on a lower part of the list despite his ability to perform
          more than well in this category.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          As said above, Lethal Tempo is the best rune you can take on this
          Champion. When you pair it with your W, you will go into attack speed
          galore from insane distances.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              Another (and certainly not the last) ADC on this list is the
              Noxian executioner. This ax spinning, bloodthirsty maniac is one
              of the hardest-hitting AD Champions in the entire League Roster.
              Differing from some other ADCs of today, Draven excels at focusing
              down single targets and killing them in
              seconds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              A fed Draven can only take up to 2-3 spinning basic attacks in the
              late game to obliterate most enemies. Tanks can take a bit more,
              but you get the gist of it. He can work with many different
              builds, though focusing on AD and Critical is what I\u2019d
              recommend. His laning phase is incredible due to his powerful
              passive that stacks up as you kill minions and catch your Q axes.
              This passive gives you bonus gold for each kill you get, depending
              on the number of stacks you had.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              This means Draven can get
              <em
                >fed,<\/em> and he can do it quick. If you stack up a lot of
                Adoration (the name of the passive) and get a kill, you can have
                1 or even 2 whole items up above your enemy ADC, which just
                immediately wins the game for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          This marksman jungler is a rat, and I\u2019ve never
                          seen such a fitting look for a Champion in my entire
                          life. He plays as a rat, he feels like a rat, and he
                          actually is one. How shocking. Twitch is the ADC
                          Evelynn. Though his burst damage is nonexistent, the
                          speed and power of his basic attacks are nothing to
                          skim at.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Twitch has a solid early game but starts snowballing
                          after level 6. This is due to his Ultimate \u2013
                          Spray and pray \u2013 being at the core of his
                          strength. It grants him bonus AD and Range, and with a
                          solid Attack Speed, he can eviscerate enemies. The
                          spell also buffs his on-hit effects and can Critically
                          Strike,
                          <em
                            >and<\/em> it also pierces through
                            enemies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                            <p>
                              This makes Twitch the well-known Pentakiller we
                              hate to see in the enemy team. His invisibility,
                              mobility, and power are incredible and grant him a
                              bit higher spot on this list.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                          Everyone\u2019s favorite Vampire
                                          Huntress is also likely
                                          everyone\u2019s bane of existence. I
                                          hate to see Vayne in the enemy team. I
                                          really do. This has mostly to do with
                                          her ability to snowball despite being
                                          overwhelmed during the early and even
                                          mid-game. She doesn\u2019t take much
                                          to become powerful, and it\u2019d be
                                          an understatement to say she has
                                          comeback potential.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                          She has True Damage on her E, which
                                          does more damage the more HP her
                                          target has. This makes her a walking
                                          anti-tank rifle. Her kit is great and
                                          offers a lot of flat-damage bonuses
                                          that can severely hurt if she lands
                                          the 3 shots she needs for the E
                                          proc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                          Overall, Vayne is very hard to
                                          contain. You will need to expend most
                                          of your time in the game against her
                                          focusing her down and preventing her
                                          from coming back. It will not prove
                                          easy, however, especially if she has a
                                          solid
                                          counter-jungler.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                              better due to the extra attack
