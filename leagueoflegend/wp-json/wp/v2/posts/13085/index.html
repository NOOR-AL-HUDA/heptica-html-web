3 Best Supports for Varus in Season 11"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  Varus&#8217;s popularity spiked a lot in season 11 of League of Legends. A
  couple of buffs to his damage combined with the mythic item changes opened a
  way for this marksman to shine on the Rift. Currently, there are two different
  build paths for Varus. One focuses on his on-hit damage and attack speed. And
  the other build favors <a

  But whatever is your preference, you still need to know which supports are the
  best for Varus in season 11!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  Varus has a very specific playstyle in League, one that only a few other
  marksmen have. He requires a certain type of support that can enhance his
  ability to carry. Generally, the support champions that best suit Varus offers
  a lot of crowd control effects. But there are some that excel in this, way
  more than the others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

<p>Let&#8217;s check them out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n</p>

    <p>
      Whenever players see Morgana + Varus in the bot lane, they&#8217;re
      usually terrified. This <a
      href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends\/\"
      data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6952\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
      noopener\">bot lane combo<\/a> is simply overloaded with damage right from
      the start of the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Level 1 as Varus and Morgana should be aggressive. This means that you can
      always go for an invade or a sneaky snare from the brush. The combined
      power of Morgana&#8217;s root and Varus&#8217;s arrow is enough to secure
      a kill in the early game. And experienced players try to take advantage of
      it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      But Morgana comes with another benefit for Varus &#8211; her spell shield.
      Varus doesn&#8217;t have any mobility and no defensive abilities either.
      His build is always offensive, so having a spell shield to keep him out of
      trouble is almost mandatory.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      After level 6, Varus and Morgana have a way easier time dealing with their
      opponents. Varus&#8217;s R travels faster than Morgana&#8217;s Q, so he
      can always take the first turn in snaring their opponent. Morgana can
      follow this either with Q or her ultimate to lock the target down. This
      makes it easy for Varus to hit his empowered arrow and get the
      kills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              Leona has a very defined playstyle in the bot lane &#8211; <a
              href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions\/\"
              data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8923\" target=\"_blank\"
              rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">crowd control<\/a> and tanking. And
              it&#8217;s quite obvious why she perfectly fits Varus and how he
              usually plays the laning phase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Leona provides a long duration of crowd control, which Varus
              desperately needs for successfully landing his Q. But the
              advantage of Leona over other supports is that she doesn&#8217;t
              rely on her ultimate to do this. Both of her Q and E abilities can
              hold a target down as soon as level 2. This opens fantastic
              opportunities for early kills in the lane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              The kill potential of Varus and Leona doubles when they unlock
              their ultimates. Combined, they can chain <a
              href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends\/\"
              data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9722\" target=\"_blank\"
              rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CC<\/a> a target for over 5 seconds,
              which is more than enough to kill anyone in the game<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, Leona is extremely good at kiting in team
              fights. She can stop multiple enemy champions as they try to
              attack Varus. And since Varus doesn&#8217;t often build defensive
              items, this is very welcomed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                      Zyra plays a similar role to Morgana when she is paired
                      with Varus. However, Zyra offers a lot more damage than
                      Morgana throughout the game and it&#8217;s usually
                      considered the very best among the supports for Varus in
                      season 11.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One of the biggest advantages that Zyra has over Morgana
                      is the fact that her root travels through minions. This
                      makes it way easier to land the ability, which in turn
                      lets Varus secure his arrow. After level 6, Varus can
                      enhance Zyra&#8217;s damage by locking people in place so
                      Zyra can damage them with her ultimate. But this works the
                      other way around as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Many players in the lower elos underestimate the power of
                      Zyra&#8217;s plants. But experienced players will always
                      think twice about engaging Varus or Zyra when these plants
                      are up. In short, they do massive amounts of damage to
                      champions, especially in the laning phase. So make sure to
                      spawn Zyra&#8217;s plants whenever the enemies are
                      preparing to engage. They can sometimes turn the tide of
                      the battle in your favor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
