  If you <a
  href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/did-you-know-total-league-of-legends-player-count-updated-2020\/\"
  data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6960\">play League of Legends<\/a>, then you hear
  the word &#8220;inting&#8221; a lot. Truthfully, it is not explicitly bound to
  LoL, but that is where it originally comes from.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  In short, &#8220;inting&#8221; stands for &#8220;intentional feeding&#8221;
  &#8211; the act when a player purposely loses the game for an entire team. It
  is &#8220;intentional&#8221; because they do it out of their own will and
  &#8220;feeding&#8221; because they feed the opponent with gold and experience,
  which in turn makes it almost impossible to win.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  But &#8220;inting&#8221; is used for so many more League&#8217;s gameplay
  cases than for just the intentional feeding. Players and streamers alike can
  flag the most random moments as &#8220;inting&#8221;, even though they have
  nothing in common with the original meaning. And by this point, the word is
  rarely used for what it was meant for at the beginning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  So, how did this happen? How did League of Legends give birth to one of the
  most well-known yet most misused terms in the gaming industry? And why is it
  important to understand it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n

    <p>
      In truth, &#8220;inting&#8221; has always been there. There is probably no
      correct answer to when players first started using the word. League of
      Legends is a naturally very competitive game, and the origin might be in
      the implementation of the ranked system. That is because competitiveness
      touches the emotional side of every one of us, and not always in a good
      way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, it is quite normal to feel bad sometimes when you&#8217;re
      playing a game. Everybody does. But if a person loses control of how they
      feel, then things like &#8220;tilt&#8221; and &#8220;inting&#8221; are
      very likely to happen as well. And when the positive emotions aren&#8217;t
      there to drive us to victory, and instead the negative ones urge us to
      lose the game at all costs, that&#8217;s when the real problems
      appear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      But &#8220;inting&#8221; isn&#8217;t only &#8220;intentionally
      feeding&#8221;. The term has also been coined for just &#8220;playing
      badly&#8221;. &#8220;Inter&#8221; can be called anyone who has a hard time
      in the game and does many misplays. Popular streamers and pro players
      often call their in-game mistakes &#8220;inting&#8221;. They do it
      sarcastically, but people have generally accepted it and continue to
      knowingly misuse it over the years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the line between toxic people who specifically login to ruin games
      and regular people who just do what they can in the game is totally
      blurred. This wouldn&#8217;t be much of a problem if it was all fun and
      games. But the truth is that it can hurt our <a
      href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/why-is-league-of-legends-community-so-toxic\/\"
      data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9044\">community<\/a> in the long run.
      Repeatedly bashing people for &#8220;inting&#8221; can turn off many new
      players away from League of Legends and stop the existing players from
      trying their best to win.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      And yes, the pro players and the <a
      href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/top-10-most-popular-female-league-streamers-on-twitch-2020\/\"
      data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8152\">streamers<\/a> don&#8217;t mean any
      harm when saying the word &#8220;inting&#8221; like that. But we all have
      to try and be better teammates and gamers, so we don&#8217;t spread the
      real &#8220;inting&#8221; further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

        <p>
          One of the most famous examples for &#8220;inting&#8221; in the LoL
          community is&nbsp;<em
            >Tyler1<\/em>. Tyler1 is known for many things like
            &#8220;challenger player&#8221;, &#8216;best Draven&#8221;, and
            &#8220;popular streamer&#8221;, but also for &#8220;toxic
            player&#8221;, &#8220;promoter of inting&#8221;, and &#8220;banned
            streamer&#8221;. During season 5 and 6, Tyler1 was such a trendy
            figure on Twitch that his streams had massive audiences coming in.
            But the real reason why his gameplay was so much viewed is that he
            was known to regularly &#8220;int&#8221;.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            <p>
              Tyler1 wasn&#8217;t a bad player at all; he was a challenger level
              ADC. But people would regularly tune in to his stream just for the
              chance to watch a high ranked player destroy the solo queue for
              many other players, including some pros. Tyler1 was so tiltable
              back then that if his teammates did something that he personally
              didn&#8217;t like, he would straight &#8220;run it down
              mid&#8221;. He would repeatedly die and feed the enemy players
              until defeat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Riot Games issued <a
              href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/loltyler1\">Tyler1<\/a> an ID ban,
              which forbade him to play League of Legends. That enraged many of
              his fans, who kept jumping in games and imitating him by
              &#8220;inting&#8221; and &#8220;running down mid&#8221;. And while
              Tyler1 was gone for a long time, Riot Games eventually welcomed
              him back to the community a few years later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, Tyler1 is &#8220;reformed&#8221; (a term that symbolizes a
              positive change in a player, usually meaning that he has overcome
              <a
              href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/how-to-stop-being-toxic-in-league-of-legends\/\"
              data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8584\">toxicity<\/a>). His streams
              still gather the biggest audiences on Twitch, but today he is one
              of the most positive persons to watch play the game. But
              regardless of everything, he is still responsible for massively
              promoting &#8220;inting&#8221; in League of Legends and has
              negatively influenced many other people&#8217;s
              experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              But the spreading of &#8220;inting&#8221; can happen to anybody.
              If we let our emotions get the better of us on a bad day, then we
              can ruin League of Legends for the people in our matches. And if
              we do that, then those people have a chance to inflict negativity
              on other people. It is an endless chain that we, the LoL players,
              have to overcome it sometime.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                  Truthfully, no one can escape &#8220;inting,&#8221; and no one
                  is &#8220;untiltable&#8221;. Even the most dedicated
                  professional players fall victim to their emotions and
                  &#8220;int&#8221;. And that&#8217;s because we&#8217;re all
                  human beings, after all! We&#8217;re susceptible to certain
                  feelings and can not always get a firm grip on them. But the
                  most important thing is to be aware of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  If someone in your game is &#8220;inting&#8221;, then you
                  aren&#8217;t left with much of a choice. You could always talk
                  to them and try to be their friend. They will often have
                  blinding rage and will want to lose the game, even if
                  you&#8217;re winning. But sometimes they can calm down and let
                  you carry them to victory. And if that doesn&#8217;t work,
                  then you should report them for intentionally causing you a
                  defeat and let Riot&#8217;s system make them aware of their
                  actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  But, if you recognize that you&#8217;re &#8220;inting&#8221;
                  in a game, then the best solution will always be to just quit
                  and play another time. There are numerous activities or video
                  games that can calm you and reset your mindset for your next
                  games. Having a &#8220;fresh&#8221; mentality is a big reason
                  behind many winning streaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  And while we can&#8217;t permanently delete
                  &#8220;inting&#8221; from League of Legends, there are things
                  that all of us could do to minimize its effect. It takes both
                  desire, effort, and work, but it isn&#8217;t impossible. So go
                  on and be a better teammate. Do it for yourself and do it for
                  League.&nbsp;<em
