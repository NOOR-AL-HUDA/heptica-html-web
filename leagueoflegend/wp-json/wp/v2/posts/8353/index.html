        <p>
          Nocturne is one of the strongest sleepers picks in the mid lane this
          patch because he does really well against most picks, including Zed,
          TF, and Yasuo. He has an all-around kit with a damage boost, spell
          shield and an attack speed buff. His Ultimate also allows for some
          nasty roams as he can gank any lane from the River, instantly helping
          him to catch an early kill. Nocturne is definitely worth picking up as
          a pocket pick as he\u2019s shown to always come back in a variety of
          metas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

            href=\"https:\/\/www.op.gg\/champion\/talon\/statistics\/mid\">Talon<\/a>
            is a great pick because of his early kill potential and his ability
            to roam using Assassin&#8217;s Path (E). Many
            <strong
              ><em
                >meta mid lane champions <\/em><\/strong>(Cassiopeia, Kassadin,
                Galio) need a few items before they reach their full potential,
                but Talon is different. Talon is the optimal counter pick to
                most of those champions because he can apply immense pressure
                early in the lane and either collect solo kills or push the wave
                and look to roam. A fed Talon forces the enemy team to play
                conservatively because of his roaming potential and makes it
                easier for his team to get leads that they can snowball into a
                victory.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          Galio is the complete crowd control package in the mid
                          lane. He can burst down backline targets while also
                          providing a ton of <a

                          control<\/a>. Galio&#8217;s best asset in solo queue,
                          however, is his ability to roam. His ultimate,
                          Hero&#8217;s Entrance (R), allows him to turn trades
                          for his allies around the map and gives him incredible
                          mobility. Galio is a great choice for the mid lane for
                          his ability to turn team fights in his favour and get
                          his allies ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                            With the new love of AP Junglers, AD Assassins like
                            Zed can finally be played without the imbalance of
                            damage split. Zed has made his way back to being
                            number one in the mid lane. His strong laning phase
                            and ability to dominate one-on-ones makes him an
                            excellent choice. However, Zed is a hard champ to
                            master and requires a lot of practice before you can
                            fully dominate your opponents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
