You Play League of Legends With VPN?"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  VPN is one of the most popular services in our modern-day world. But playing
  League of Legends with VPN is one of those topics people are very conflicted
  about. There are some positive and some negative sides to it. And in this
  post, we\u2019ll talk about all of them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  But before we do so, know that the idea of playing League of Legends with VPN
  isn\u2019t a new one. People had always tried to make it work, even when the
  game was still young. First, because they wanted to keep their privacy and
  separate their LoL accounts from their real-life personalities. And second,
  for some people, VPN is the only way to actually access League!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

        Well, let\u2019s first understand what exactly VPN is how it operates.
        Then we\u2019ll explore why you should or shouldn\u2019t play League of
        Legends with a VPN service on!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                      <p>
                        Well, they do it by disguising your actual IP address
                        and hiding it from the internet. So when you search the
                        internet or play games online, the VPN company sends
                        that data from their base rather than your own IP.
                        That\u2019s why through VPN, you can acquire a different
                        IP every time you log in on the
                        internet.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Additionally, all the searches and all the traffic that
                        you do while you have a VPN on is transformed into an
                        unreadable code by the VPN service. This way, no one can
                        actually see what you\u2019re doing on the internet and
                        who\u2019s doing all those searches.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And for gamers, this may sound ideal! Being able to
                        connect to everyone on the internet and play League of
                        Legends with them while your identity is secured seems
                        like the dream, doesn\u2019t it?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, using a VPN for gaming does have some major
                        implications for the safety of your
                        accounts!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                      <p>
                        So let\u2019s talk about those
                        implications!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                Short answer &#8211; yes! You can totally play
                                League of Legends with any VPN service, no
                                matter whether it\u2019s free or premium.
                                Changing your IP address and hiding your current
                                location doesn\u2019t necessarily stop you from
                                login into your LoL account, but it may hurt you
                                in the long run!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                    If you haven\u2019t noticed, Riot Games have
                                    been really dedicated to making their users
                                    (us, the players) as secure as possible
                                    lately. They\u2019ve introduced free account
                                    name and password changes, but also email
                                    confirmations. And you simply must confirm
                                    that you\u2019re the owner of the account by
                                    identifying yourself to Riot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                    The reason why this is important is that the
                                    VPN services do the complete opposite to
                                    this!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                        The real problem of playing League of
                                        Legends with VPN is that it changes your
                                        IP address &#8211; the same IP address
                                        that Riot Games identify you with in
                                        their data. So when you log in from a
                                        completely new location with the same
                                        account, Riot detects that as a possible
                                        hacking\/selling\/sharing that
                                        account!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                        If you log in three or four times to LoL
                                        in one day, each time using a different
                                        IP address, chances are that Riot will
                                        notice that. And they might be forced to
                                        put a stop to that account because, to
                                        them, it seems sketchy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                        VPN for playing League of

                                                In my opinion &#8211; no! The
                                                risk of getting your account
                                                banned is simply not worth it.
                                                And if your only reason for
                                                wanting to play LoL with VPN is
                                                just to secure yourself, my
                                                advice is to not even try it!
                                                You can use your VPN service for
                                                everything else you do on the
                                                internet, but you should disable
                                                it for logging into
                                                League.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                                      For some people, not
                                                      having a VPN service is an
                                                      issue for playing League.
                                                      That\u2019s because their
                                                      own internet providers
                                                      have pre-determined
                                                      settings that block many
                                                      potentially harmful sites
                                                      and applications. And some
                                                      of them detect League of
                                                      Legends and other games as
                                                      such.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                                      But even though there are
                                                      things you can do to
                                                      unblock League of Legends
                                                      and remove it from that
                                                      list, VPN also solves that
                                                      problem for you. It
                                                      removes all those
                                                      regulations that your
                                                      internet provider might
                                                      have for safety or
                                                      otherwise. And the VPN
                                                      lets you login into LoL
                                                      and play!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
