Build For Jhin In URF"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  Jhin can be a pretty crazy champion in URF. There are certainly more
  oppressive picks, but in League of Legends, you don\u2019t always have to
  follow patch notes and play the strongest champion to win! Jhin is the perfect
  example of that! If you\u2019re familiar with his kit and have the right
  build, you\u2019ll one-shot people left and right. And if you don\u2019t, then
  don\u2019t worry &#8211; we\u2019ll be covering everything!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

<p>
  <em
    >So, let\u2019s see a quick overview of what Jhin can do in
    URF!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n
    <h1>
      Strengths and Weaknesses<\/h1>\n\n\n\n
      <p>
        The first thing that you should take advantage of is the range. Jhin has
        some of the longest spells in League of Legends, which he can use to get
        total control over his enemies. In URF, Jhin can stay pretty safe while
        dealing massive amounts of damage, mainly through his&nbsp;<strong
          >R<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong
            >W<\/strong>, and&nbsp;<strong
              >E<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
              <p>
                Also, because of URF&#8217;s rapid gameplay, Jhin scales
                extremely quickly with just a couple of early kills. Grabbing
                Infinity Edge before your opponents can complete their first
                items means a one-shot potential for the rest of the
                game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
              </p>
              <p>
                However, Jhin is also one of the <a
                href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol\/\"
                data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8996\">squishiest champions<\/a> in
                URF. He doesn\u2019t have any real escape besides his
                Summoner\u2019s spells. And that can be a real problem against a
                lot of mobile enemies. Jhin struggles to get away from someone
                who jumps or dashes every other second, so&nbsp;<strong
                  >champions like Fizz, Akali, or Zed can be nightmares for
                  him.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n
                  <p>
                    But, Jhin\u2019s greatest friend in URF is his movement
                    speed. A big part of your playstyle will be focused on
                    getting bursts of MS and outrunning your
                    opponents.&nbsp;<strong

                          In URF, you will be using your abilities way more
                          often than your auto attacks, so it\u2019s vital for
                          you to know what they do before playing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>

                            >Q &#8211; Dancing Grenade<\/strong>&nbsp;is a
                            bouncing bomb that jumps off of 4 targets and deals
                            damage to them. This is a great filler spell in the
                            kit and URF. You can basically spam it all the time.
                            His&nbsp;<strong
                              >W &#8211; Deadly Flourish<\/strong>&nbsp;is a
                              perfect follow up for his&nbsp;<strong
                                >Q<\/strong>. It is a long-range damaging
                                ability that roots the target if Jhin or any
                                other ally has previously hit him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                <p>
                                  The W is perhaps the primary spell for Jhin in
                                  URF. Because of the low cooldowns, you can
                                  constantly root targets, one after the other.
                                  The ability is on a 2-4 seconds cooldown
                                  throughout the game, and on a max level, its
                                  root effect lasts for 2 seconds! That\u2019s
                                  crazy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                      Audience<\/strong>&nbsp;is an invisible
                                      trap ability that Jhin can lay around the
                                      map. Enemies detonate it when they step on
                                      it. The trap slows everyone around it and
                                      deals damage in its center after a brief
                                      delay. What is genius about it on URF is
                                      that there is no limit to how many traps
                                      you can set! You can literally travel the
                                      whole Summoner\u2019s Rift and place 50 or
                                      100 of them, then watch your enemies
                                      struggle to pass them by!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                          shots to blast your target with, 3 of
                                          which are regular, but the 4th one is
                                          a critical shot. Every hit also slows
                                          your enemies, so it\u2019s a great
                                          finisher!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                                      However, Jhin should
                                                      always start with W first.
                                                      This is because of the
                                                      level 1 fights in URF, so
                                                      having a long-range snare
                                                      is really helpful to win
                                                      them all. But the Q is the
                                                      biggest damaging ability
                                                      early on, so maxing it
                                                      first is always the best
                                                      choice!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
