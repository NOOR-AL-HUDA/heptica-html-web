  system allowed League of Legends players to showcase their skills with a
  specific champion. If you\u2019re wondering about Champion Mastery and would
  like to know how to reach the highest mastery score, then this guide is for
  you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

    >What is Champion Mastery?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n
    <p>
      Starting out, we\u2019re going to explain champion mastery to you. Long
      story short, Champion mastery tracks the progression of a specific
      champion in terms of familiarity, skill, and
      experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      With champion mastery, there are a total of 7 mastery
      levels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      You\u2019ll need certain items to craft a Mastery badge, such as&nbsp;<a

      Mastery tokens.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Each LoL player will start off with 0 mastery points. As you win games and
      progress, you will earn what is called champion points (CP), which will be
      added to your mastery level.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The number of champion points you earn all depends on your performance in
      the game you played.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

        quite understand mastery, and how does it work. Some players still

        <p>
          After every game you play, you will earn one of the following
          grades:<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          S+, S, S-, A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          When you first grab a champion, you\u2019re going to start out with a
          zero mastery score and a mastery level of 0.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have started to play, the champion you\u2019re playing on
          will earn points based on the grade you receive per match, increasing
          your mastery level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, the higher the grade is, the higher amount of champions
          points you\u2019re going to receive. If you have a premade party that
          you play with, since you have more members, this will also give you a
          higher percentage of champion mastery points.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Working your way through the ranks from mastery level 0 up to mastery
          level 5 shouldn\u2019t be all that hard, as long as you continuously
          play a specific champion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Every time your mastery level increases, this will give you a
          different design on your mastery badge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                    As soon as you reach mastery levels 5, 6, and 7, the game
                    will start to get interesting in terms of the mastery
                    system. The mastery system involves much more than simply
                    playing the game to earn points. Players need to demonstrate
                    their skill and familiarity with the champion through grade
                    performance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                      <p>
                        S+ is the highest grade you can get in LOL, and it
                        isn\u2019t exactly easy to earn this grade, so if you
                        earn it, pat yourself on the back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        S grades are essential because they are necessary once
                        you have reached level 5 mastery. For level 4 mastery
                        and below, the S grades aren\u2019t as important because
                        they\u2019re not needed if you want to go from a level 3
                        mastery to a level 4 mastery. However, for a level 5
                        mastery, you\u2019ll need to receive at least two S-
                        grades if you\u2019re looking forward to upgrading to a
                        level 6 mastery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Once you have worked your way up to level 6 mastery, you
                        will need to receive three S or S+ grades to move to
                        level 7 mastery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Once you have reached level 7 mastery, you should be
                        proud of yourself because this is the highest tier of
                        all mastery levels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
