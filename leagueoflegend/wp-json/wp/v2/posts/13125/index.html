Best Attack Speed Items in League of Legends"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  Everyone likes speed. Even more so when that speed means you can pummel
  opponents with attacks so fast, they wouldn\u2019t even know what hit
  them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  League of Legends offers a large variety of attack speed items to suit your
  best needs. This particular buff is built into every role in the game, and
  there are barely any Champions that wouldn\u2019t enjoy a little
  speed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  I compiled what I believe are the best overall attack speed items based on
  what they offer. Flat attack speed is not the only determining factor, but
  what surrounds it is the key.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  So, without dragging on for too long, ready your
  <strong
    >Frozen Hearts,<\/strong> and let\u2019s begin with our
    list.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

          A staple attack speed item, Guinsoo\u2019s has been extra insane since
          the item changes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          With a +40% attack speed, it will make your attacks blazing fast. But
          that is not all this item has to offer. It modifies your critical
          strikes, making them a lot more potent than you\u2019d think was
          normal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          It offers a +20% critical attack and an incredible passive ability
          called
          <strong
            >Wrath<\/strong> that converts critical% into bonus on-hit
            Damage.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            <p>
              It also has another passive
              <strong
                >Seething Strike<\/strong> that amplifies your on-hit effects by
                100% after you stack it up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                <p>
                  If you thought
                  <strong
                    >Master Yi<\/strong> was strong before, you\u2019ve seen
                    nothing yet, as this item makes hard-hitting fighters like

                              Attack Speed but doesn\u2019t end there. It has

                                    with the sum of +14% movement speed,
                                    you\u2019ll be running through the enemies
