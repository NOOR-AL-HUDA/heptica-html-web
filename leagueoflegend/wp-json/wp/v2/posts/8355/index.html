<p>
  League of Legends Patch 10.15 went live on July 22. The patch includes several
  nerfs and buffs to champs including Fiddlesticks and Lee Sin, and also the
  brand new jungler, Lillia. With that in mind, here are the

          While Fiddlesticks received a nerf this patch that reduced the healing
          off of minions from 25% to 15%, this will not affect
          Fiddlesticks&#8217; farm and overall ability to impact a game with his

            Karthus deals crazy damage. His ultimate is both oppressive and
            powerful and you can always expect Karthus to lead the damage
            charts. He was moved back to the Top Tier because of the buffs he
            received to help him become a mid laner last patch. These buffs also
            helped his Jungle gameplay and made him stronger and a pocket pick
            for Patch 10.15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              While there may be champions who can do more damage, Kayn is
              extremely easy to carry games with. In his red form, Kayn can heal
              for absurd amounts of damage while also being able to provide
              knock-ups and solid damage. Kayn can be weak until he is done with
              his transformation&#8211;the best way to expedite this process is
              to camp one of your laners in the early game. If Kayn gets any
              type of lead, he is extremely difficult to deal with and one of
              the best carry junglers in Patch 10.15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              <p>
                His incredible turret dive potential has made him an even better
                Jungler as he can very easily gank any lane without the fear of
                dying to the enemy tower. He is much stronger as a Jungler than
                a Top Laner because as a Jungler, he is able to impact any lane
                with his Ultimate. He continues to be one of the best early game
                junglers and becomes a massive tank late-game that allows him to
                greatly influence team fights. Volibear&#8217;s ability to act
                as both a front line presence and a dive threat make him a
                nightmare to deal with. There are very few situations where the
                current Volibear feels out of place and his versatility makes
                him this patch&#8217;s second-best pick in the
                jungle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                  Kha\u2019Zix is one of the fastest rising stars in the jungle
                  and is single-handedly shaping the meta due to his
                  overwhelming performance against certain matchups like Master
                  Yi and Lee Sin. He\u2019s also one of the few champions that
                  has a very positive win rate against Ekko and destroys Kayn in
                  Gold, currently making him a god slayer. He does suffer
                  against Volibear and Rammus but all his other matchups are
                  playable, even those that are slightly unfavorable. Definitely
                  the most well suited and strongest Jungler in Patch
                  10.15.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
