      Depending on rank, Diana is banned in between 10% and 28.65% of LoL games.
      Diana lacks the unusual element, but she does have a library of crowd
      control abilities. What makes her get the banhammer, though, would be the
      amount of power damage she can do when she is close to you. Of course,
      there are other champions that are more complicated to deal with, but the
      raw damage that Diana has is something you will want to stay away from as
      much as you can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

          Ekko is a champion that is banned in nearly 28% of games \u2013
          obviously, with this high percentage, people fear Ekko. Ekko has some
          nasty&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\"
          href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends\/\"
          rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">crowd control<\/a>&nbsp;in the form of
          slows and stuns (no one likes that), so players get nervous when
          he\u2019s around, and this is why people try to avoid Ekko
          altogether.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the main reason Ekko gets the banhammer is due to his safety
          net of an ultimate \u2013 this ultimate rewinds him to the place he
          was four seconds prior. Not only does it rewind him, but he
          regenerates health as well. This type of sustainability can make Ekko
          a hard champion to kill.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              Blitzcrank is banned in around 30 percent of games \u2013 this
              champion has a unique type of crowd control \u2026one that we
              really want to stay away from. He has a pull and uppercut combo
              capable of pulling enemies right into a team fight, and if he
              manages to hit the right target, the fight could be over right
              away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              While there are many strategies against Blitzcrank (he\u2019s been
              in League of Legends since the beginning), he\u2019s still one
              that people try to avoid. Remember, just because something has
              some age to it that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t work-
              Blitzcrank is far from rusty, so he\u2019s probably not going to
              be sent to the junkyard anytime soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                  Leona is banned between 15 percent and 28 percent of the time
                  \u2013 this is the type of champion that is all about her
                  stuns. She may not be able to eliminate champions alone, but
                  with her stunning ultimate (it has a long-range), she can

                      The way in which he kills is what makes him powerful. With
                      his multi-target damage capabilities combined with his
                      self-healing power, he moves so fast that it\u2019s almost
                      impossible to target him. When he is properly stacked with
                      lifesteal items to heal himself even more, you will either
                      need to stun him or\u2026how about just ban
                      him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          When Senna first came out, her performance wasn\u2019t
                          very inspiring at all. Now, Senna is being banned in
                          between 10 percent to 30 percent of games. She is
                          capable of being a support champion, or you can play
                          her as an ADC champion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                        <p>
                          What really gives Senna the banhammer is the fact that
                          her utility and damage comes with some long-range
                          attacks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                              Basically, if you\u2019re familiar with Yasuo and
                              Yi, you\u2019ll understand that Yasuo has
                              everything Yi has. However, Yasuo has a ban-rate
                              that is slightly higher \u2013 42.49 percent.
                              He\u2019s not as fast as Yi, so he can be
                              targeted, but his win-barrier ability makes it
                              almost impossible to put a ranged ultimate on him.
                              He\u2019s also pretty good in team fights as there
                              are times when he can completely wipe out enemy
                              ultimates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              He has a passive that gives off a lot of
                              shielding\u2026so much that the other mid-laners
                              may struggle when it comes to taking this champion
                              down. Also, Yasuo isn\u2019t as limited as Yi
                              \u2013 he has some pretty good crowd control that
                              will work in various situations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                  Aphelios has a ban rate that is between 15
                                  percent and 48 percent, depending on rank.
                                  This champion is usually locked in as a
                                  bottom-lane ranged assassin, but he can change
                                  weapons. This ability gives him everything
                                  from crowd control to range \u2013 he even has
                                  turret damage so that he can hold his lane
                                  position. You\u2019ll find many pro players
                                  out there picking Aphelios as their
                                  champion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                  Aphelioss has a complexity that is just as
                                  much a downfall as it is his strength. There
                                  are many more reasons to ban Aphelios than the
                                  fact that he\u2019s a threat to his enemy.
                                  When you\u2019re stuck with a teammate who
                                  doesn\u2019t know how to handle their champion
                                  in League of Legend, it doesn&#8217;t feel
                                  nice. Have you ever had to share a lane with
                                  someone who doesn\u2019t do well on Aphelios?
                                  It can be devastating\u2026just as devastating
                                  as standing up against a good
                                  Aphelios.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                      Sett is another League of Legend champion
                                      that the pros love to go for. This
                                      champion can be used anywhere from mid
                                      lane to top lane to the jungle. Due to his
                                      versatility, he is banned between 11
                                      percent to 49 percent of games, depending
                                      on his tier. Sett also just so happens to
                                      be one of the newer champions on this list
                                      of the top LoL champions that are
                                      banned.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                      Many League of Legends players choose to
                                      ban new champions so that their teammates
                                      don\u2019t choose a champ they probably
                                      don\u2019t fully know yet. His AOE damage,
                                      general swagger, and crowd control make
                                      him a champion that is worthy of the
                                      banhammer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                      On a side note, Sett is able to shield
                                      himself for half his health. No big deal,
                                      just ban him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
