does SS mean in League of Legends &#8211; A Complete
Guide"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  In the video game world, we have many abbreviations. Some of those
  abbreviations, we can understand what they mean right away without having to
  look them up, while other abbreviations will have us wondering, &#8220;what
  does that even mean?&#8221; The other day, my friend texted me and said,
  &#8220;What is SS in League of Legends?&#8221;&nbsp; He&#8217;s actually the
  one who inspired this article, as I figured some of my readers might not know
  what SS in League of Legends stands for, so that is what I am going to cover
  today.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  In MOBA-style games, like League of Legends and DotA, it is common to see the
  abbreviation SS. This is an abbreviation that someone will toss out there when
  an enemy champion is missing \u2013 it is also referred to as MIA from their
  lane.\u00a0 While in DotA, the abbreviation SS may mean \u201cStay Safe,\u201d
  but in League of Legends, it basically means MIA from the lane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  If you play a lot of League of Legends, whenever someone from the opposing
  team has gone missing from their lane, you may see someone type out \u201cSS
  bot\/mid\/top\u201d in order to communicate to the rest of the team that they
  no longer have a visual on the individual(s) in their lane.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >Long story short, \u201css\u201d is a short version of \u201cMiss.\u201d In
    certain regions, the abbreviation is going to differentiate between
    \u201cSS\u201d and \u201cMIA,\u201d which is used when referring to a
    specific opponent who is missing and cannot be
    located.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n
    <p>
      <strong
        ><em
          >SS (SS bot, SS bot 2, and so on)\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n
          <p>
            This is normally only used during the laning phase of League of
            Legends. The player should type the lane the enemy is missing from
            after &#8220;SS,&#8221; and numerous enemies who are missing can be
            inserted afterward. SO, for example, &#8220;SS top 2&#8221; can be
            translated as meaning &#8220;2 enemy champions have disappeared from
            the laning top.&#8221; This means that the team&#8217;s mid should
            be careful and watch their backs, just as you should as
            well.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                >MIA (MIA Shaco, MIA Noct, and so
                on)<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n
                <p>
                  MIA (Missing in Action) is when an enemy champion is missing,
                  and your team isn&#8217;t able to find the location. When
                  you&#8217;re going into a teamfight, and you can only find 4
                  enemies ahead of you, then this may mean that a champion like
                  Fiddlesticks is going to pounce on you and come out of his
                  hiding place.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                <p>
                  People who are on North American (NA) servers will usually use
                  MIA for the following purpose:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>MIA Shaco<\/li></li>
                  <li>
                    MIA Mid<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n

                      Enemy champion missing, the shortened form of
                      &#8220;miss&#8221; is &#8220;SS,&#8221; and it is more
                      common to see this on European Servers than
                      &#8220;MIA.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                  Abbreviations, such as &#8220;SS,&#8221; are
                                  commonly used in League of Legends simply
                                  because the player doesn&#8217;t have all the
                                  time in the world to sit there and type out
                                  everything fully. You know, they have a game
                                  to play and lanes to control, so typing out
                                  &#8220;SS&#8221; or &#8220;MIA&#8221; is so
                                  much easier than trying to type out a long
                                  sentence to explain whose missing and where
                                  they&#8217;re missing from while trying to

                                            AFK has been used for as long as I
                                            remember \u2013 back when I was a
                                            teen, I would use the abbreviation
                                            \u201cAFK.\u201d However, I have
                                            found a couple of people who
                                            didn\u2019t know what AFK meant. AFK
                                            simply means \u201caway from
                                            Keyboard.\u201d However, you\u2019re
                                            going to be surprised in League of
                                            Legends, because AFK doesn\u2019t
                                            necessarily mean that the player has
                                            walked away from their keyboard. In
                                            LoL, when you see someone say
                                            &#8220;AFK&#8221;, this extends to
                                            those players who don&#8217;t seem
                                            to be paying attention or those
                                            champions who are standing around
                                            with their hands in their pockets
                                            (doing nothing). If you have a
                                            player who accuses you of being AFK,
                                            it would be a good idea to refute it
                                            openly so that other players
                                            don&#8217;t report you for being AFK
                                            at the end of the game. If you get
                                            marked with AFK too much, Riot may

                                                once they have had enough gold
                                                to buy a couple of items they

                                                        lot like stun because
