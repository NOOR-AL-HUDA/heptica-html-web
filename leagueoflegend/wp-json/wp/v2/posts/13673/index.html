7 Best Supports for Sivir in Season 11"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  When it comes to choosing a good support for Sivir in League of Legends, you
  don&#8217;t have a lot of choices. Sivir is a very simple champion and her
  ability kit doesn&#8217;t offer too many different playstyles. And even though
  she can build two different ways in season 11, she is quite limited to what
  type of support suits her. So today we&#8217;re talking about the 7 best
  supports for Sivir in LoL!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  The champions that are listed below all have one or multiple ways of enhancing
  Sivir&#8217;s damage and survivability. You should heavily consider them when
  communicating with your bot lane partner or locking in Sivir when your solo
  queue support has already selected them. These combos are powerful enough even
  without communicating, so they&#8217;re worth checking out!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

        <p>
          Since the dawn of time, Morgana and Sivir have been an incredible
          pair. Sivir, in general, goes very well with supports that either
          provide a lot of <a
          href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends\/\"
          data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
          noopener\">crowd control<\/a> or a lot of healing. Morgana&#8217;s Q
          is an obnoxious ability in League of Legends, especially in the laning
          phase. If She can bully her opponents with the snare, Sivir can keep
          poking them until they die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Another element of the synergy between these two champions comes into
          play after level 6. Sivir&#8217;s R grants movement speed to her
          allies and Morgana can use this effect to get near the enemy
          champions. Players usually try to get out of the range of
          Morgana&#8217;s ultimate, either by using Flash or running. But with
          Sivir&#8217;s movement speed, Morgana can chase them down and secure
          her stun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          It may not seem like it, but the fact that both Sivir and Morgana have
          a spell shield is really OP. The reason for this is because it opens
          more opportunities. When Morgana is paired with another ADC, she
          usually spends her E on them. But with Sivir, Morgana can cast the
          shield on herself so they both become immune to CC in team fights or
          when the enemy jungler ganks their lane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                <p>
                  When paired with Leona, Sivir tends to perform incredibly well
                  too. Both of these champions have ways to help one another
                  during the laning phase and later on in team
                  fights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the biggest weaknesses that may set Sivir behind in a
                  game is the fact that her enemies can dodge her Q. This is the
                  only damaging ability she has and she depends on it,
                  especially if she goes for Dark Harvest and <a
                  href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/lethality-league-of-legends-how-does-it-work-updated\/\"
                  data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"7321\" target=\"_blank\"
                  rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lethality<\/a> items. Well, Leona
                  has 3 separate abilities to either snare or stun their
                  opponents so Sivir can successfully throw her
                  boomerang.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, Leona struggles when she can&#8217;t reach
                  her enemies. If she misses her ultimate, the only long-range
                  ability she has, she can&#8217;t really create plays. But
                  thanks to Sivir&#8217;s R, Leona can quickly get into range
                  for her E or Q. And this helps this combo get more kills
                  around the map.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  In team fights, Leona can help Sivir in kiting by continually
                  stunning enemy champions that are trying to get her. And that
                  makes her one of the best supports for Sivir in season
                  11.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                        <p>
                          Compared to Morgana and Leona, Yuumi doesn&#8217;t
                          bring nearly the same amount of crowd control to the
                          table. However, Yuumi has one of the <a

                          data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"10495\" target=\"_blank\"

                          League of Legends<\/a>, especially in the late game.
                          And when attached to Sivir, Yuumi can be a real
                          nuisance to the enemy team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          But besides the amazing healing, Sivir benefits a lot
                          from Yuumi&#8217;s R as well. Snaring multiple enemies
                          in place is the perfect scenario for throwing her
                          boomerang with Q and spreading her auto-attacks with
                          W. Yuumi can also slow enemies down, which is also
                          pretty useful for chasing down enemies and securing
                          kills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The Sivir + Yuumi combo excels in team fights because
                          of all the survivability these champions have.
                          Sivir&#8217;s E can prevent them from getting caught
                          while Yuumi&#8217;s E will heal them when they do. And
                          experienced players will always be aggressive when
                          playing Sivir and Yuumi in the bot lane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                              So the game plan for this lane is pretty simple.
                              Pre-level 6 focus mostly on CS and poking with
                              Sivir and Braum&#8217;s Qs. Once both reach level
                              6 is where the fun begins. Sivir can ult, and
                              Braum can simply run up to the opponent and basic
                              attack using the bonus move speed to apply his
                              initial passive stack. This should be pretty
                              simple to proc, given both are moving pretty quick
                              still. Once the target is stunned, Braum can R for
                              a sweet crowd control chain, giving Sivir more
                              than enough time to do some serious
                              damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                            </p>

                              Thankfully, Sivir doesn&#8217;t solely rely on
                              Braum for peel; she has her own E, a spell shield,
                              allowing her to escape sticky situations if used
                              well. Should this not be enough, Braum has plenty
                              of ways of helping Sivir out, including his W,
                              which grants armor, and his projectile-blocking
                              shield.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                  You can call this a high-risk, high-reward
                                  combo because it&#8217;s more than an uphill
                                  battle to get back into the game if they fall
                                  behind. However, if they manage to play the
                                  early game well, it will be a highly annoying
                                  duo to deal with, as Nami can set up Sivir
                                  very well for kills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                </p>

                                  Nami hitting her bubble basically guarantees a
                                  max damage Q from Sivir, and if it&#8217;s
                                  available, chaining her Tidal Wave for a
                                  longer CC duration. An E from Nami will make
                                  Sivir&#8217;s basics apply a slow and deal
                                  bonus magic damage, making her much more
                                  sticky. All of this crowd control and buffs,
                                  plus the fact that Nami has a heal to help
                                  Sivir with sustain, makes this duo harder to
                                  deal with as the game goes on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                          Alistar&#8217;s passive compensates
                                          for Sivir&#8217;s lack of natural
                                          sustain, allowing them both to stay in

                                          Sivir up for a decent amount of poke,
                                          but hang on until level 6, which is
                                          where this duo starts to shine
                                          brightly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                          Their ultimates combine splendidly as
                                          they leave the opposition stuck
                                          between a rock and a hard place.
                                          Option one is running away, which they
                                          won&#8217;t be able to since
                                          Sivir&#8217;s ultimate gives a move
                                          speed bonus that is hard to ignore,
                                          giving Alistar an easier time to
                                          engage. Option two is staying to
                                          fight, which will definitely not be
                                          easy given how annoying Alistar is.
                                          When his ultimate is activated,
                                          there&#8217;s no way he&#8217;s going

                                                  Nautilus, or any CC champ with
                                                  a skillshot, for that matter.
                                                  You see, there&#8217;s gonna
                                                  be a lot, and I mean A LOT, of
                                                  players thinking they&#8217;re
                                                  auditioning for an LCS team,
                                                  constantly sidestepping trying
                                                  to predict when you will cast
                                                  your ability to dodge it. This
                                                  is the type of player that
                                                  allows a Nautilus to walk up
                                                  to them and bonk them in the
                                                  head with an anchor, rooting
                                                  them for a brief moment,
                                                  leaving them no room to dodge
                                                  the point-blank Q that is
                                                  definitely

                                                  Now I want you to picture that
                                                  same Nautilus walking towards
                                                  you when suddenly you hear a
                                                  Sivir yell out a battle cry.
                                                  This Nautilus is now a nuclear
                                                  submarine coming at full
                                                  throttle towards you with only
                                                  one objective in his mind:
