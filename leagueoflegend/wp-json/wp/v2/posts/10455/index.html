    Weaknesses<\/strong><\/h1>\n\n\n\n
    <p>
      When it comes to Teemo in ARAM, season 12 is his time to shine! The little
      devil has recently received an indirect buff in the form of a patch note.
      In fact, Riot Games did remove the Oracle\u2019s Extract potion, which
      made it possible for us to see invisible traps and champions. And Teemo is
      now unbeatable! There is almost nothing that can uncover him or his
      mushrooms, so nothing to counter him with! So if you want to know how to
      best build and play Teemo in ARAM in season 12, then you\u2019ve come to
      the right place!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      But, the \u201cno counterplay\u201d detail isn\u2019t the only power spike
      that Teemo received in season 12! His go-to mythic item,\u00a0<strong
        >Liandry\u2019s Anguish<\/strong>, now not only boosts the damage of his
        R &#8211; Noxious Trap, but it also provides him with mana and ability
        haste! This is crucial for his\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"

        game<\/a>\u00a0strength because his Q &#8211; Blinding Dart becomes
        basically free to cast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        <p>
          Teemo excels in every situation, really. He is good at hitting enemies
          from afar, and he is good in melee range. Hell, he doesn\u2019t even
          have to appear on the map to kill you! With the right build, Teemo can
          take down\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"

          follow this guide, you\u2019ll be able to dominate your games, if not

                        like Dark Harvest stack exceptionally quickly. This just
                        means that every time your enemies will step on one of
                        your mushrooms, the initial burst will be almost
                        tripled. And that plays a key part in doing as much
                        damage as possible as Teemo in ARAM in season

                                crazy thing about it is that this rune has only
                                4 seconds cooldown. So by the time an enemy
                                champion steps on the next trap, it will

                                        two reasons. First, the other two runes
                                        are all about warding, which you
                                        can\u2019t do in ARAM. And second,
                                        Eyeball Collection is the only damage
                                        increase. So it&#8217;s a nice buff to

                                                will lower the cooldown of your

                                                the more traps you can put out!
                                                And the more traps you can set,
                                                the more people you\u2019re
