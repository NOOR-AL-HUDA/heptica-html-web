5 Best AP Items in League of Legends"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  The most recent major update to League\u2019s gameplay was the overhaul of how
  items and itemization in general worked. This brought significant changes to
  existing items and introduced more than a few new ones, all unique in their
  own regard. Of course, as is the case with everything in the game, some are
  better than others \u2013 whether it be better scaling, usefulness, or other
  aspects. In this list, I will provide what I believe are the 5 Best AP Items
  by looking into their details and how well they perform in various
  circumstances.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>So, let\u2019s start.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n</p>

                untargetable for 2.5 seconds, but also frozen, and you cannot
                take any actions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                <p>
                  Perhaps the best anti-AD item for mages, Zohnya\u2019s is the
                  item that you will see in almost every single League game you
                  play, no matter your division and skill. It can be utilized to
                  save your life, especially when matched against one-shotting
                  Assassins like Zed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  It has the detriment of freezing you in place and shares the
                  problem of being camped on with items like Guardian
                  Angel.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  But, in any case, Zohnya\u2019s is perfect not just because it
                  is a good item but due to its useful build path. An early
                  purchase of Seeker\u2019s armguard will provide you with
                  sufficient armor (15 + 15 when you kill 30 minions) and a bit
                  of AP, allowing you to lane with ease against high AD
                  Champions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can also nab the item by opting for a stopwatch rune,
                  which will decrease the price by 650 gold and give you a
                  valuable item to have on your person until you complete the
                  full item.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  At just 2600 gold (or 1950 if you take a stopwatch),
                  Zohnya\u2019s is a fantastic item overall that shouldn\u2019t
                  be overlooked.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                      Liandry\u2019s is an item you will often
                                      see bought first against high HP
                                      champions. Its passives are a great weapon
                                      against tankier foes, and when purchased
                                      for the right Champion, Liandry\u2019s can
                                      help you burst even the mightiest
                                      targets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                      &nbsp;I like to run Liandry\u2019s on
                                      Kassadin; the 12% bonus Magic Damage makes
                                      a huge difference when you use a stacked
                                      Ult on enemies in combo with your already
                                      strong W and E. It is an all-rounded item
                                      without much situational
                                      exclusiveness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                      &nbsp;If the enemy team consists of
                                      primarily squishy targets, you can opt for
                                      something different, but I wouldn\u2019t
                                      let this incredible AP item pass that
                                      quickly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                      Lost Chapter is part of Liandry\u2019s
                                      build path, which can give you a boost to
                                      sustain, restoring 20% of max mana upon
                                      leveling up, helping you to stay in lane
                                      longer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                                  Okay, you just knew that
                                                  Rabadon\u2019s is going to be
                                                  on this list. An old item,
                                                  archaic even, Rabadon\u2019s
                                                  is the finishing touch to
                                                  every AP mage\u2019s build. It
                                                  can almost double your damage
                                                  in the late game, making it a
                                                  perfect choice to buy after
                                                  stacking modifiers with other
                                                  items. Sometimes, it may pay
                                                  off to purchase an item with
                                                  better passives, but the cases
                                                  are so few and far between
                                                  that, I won\u2019t argue for

                                                  Rabadon\u2019s is genuinely
                                                  the item of the late game;
                                                  with a bland (and expensive)
                                                  build path of two Large Rods,
                                                  there is no viability for
                                                  picking it up early on. Of
                                                  course, an exception is none
                                                  other than Veigar, who stacks
                                                  large amounts of AP with his
                                                  passive. A 35% boost to his
                                                  high damage kit makes him
                                                  incredibly lethal in the

                                                  Rabadon\u2019s is an expensive
                                                  item, coming in at 3600 gold.
                                                  It would be best to stay clear
                                                  from it until you buy at least
                                                  three items (excluding boots)
                                                  as it offers nothing other
                                                  than flat AP, which can be
                                                  countered by optimizing magic
                                                  resist defenses. Look at it
                                                  like sugar on top for
