  hundreds of millions of players around the world. With the growing popularity
  of gaming culture around the globe, Esports has found acceptance all over the
  world. With millions of dollars of prize money in every major Esports
  tournament, video games have come a long way from being merely a hobby for
  children and teenagers to being a popular sport in every sense of the
  word.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  And League of Legends is right up there at the top of the Esports stage. And
  with such popularity that Esports has found, it was inevitable to have Esports
  celebrities that play League of Legends just like every other sport. However,
  interestingly, some not-so-ordinary characters have found popularity on
  youtube and twitch. One of them is Tyler1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

      Tyler1 is an American video game streamer who streams League of Legends on
      Twitch. At one point, he was known as the most toxic player in North
      America for his disruptive behavior towards other players. He has 4.5
      million followers on Twitch, and his youtube channel sits at around 2.69
      subscribers. His real name is Tyler Steinkamp.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      He actually <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tyler1\"
      target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">got banned<\/a> from playing
      League of Legends from April 2016 to January 2018 for his toxicity. But
      when he returned, he had over 386,000 viewers on Twitch on his first
      stream after reinstatement. According to some estimates, this was the
      total number of concurrent viewership on Twitch at that time. One
      can\u2019t help but ask the question, why do people like Tyler1 so much
      despite his behavior and his record of getting banned?<\/p>\n\n\n\n

        <h2>
          <strong
            >Why do people like Tyler1 so much?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n
            <p>
              There can be several answers to this question. If you tune into
              his youtube channel and pull out any of his videos, you see a guy
              in his T-shirt being all hyped up about playing the game and its
              aftermath. All of us get excited about playing League of Legends
              and often post-match discussions about strategy and choice of
              champions, and so forth. But rarely do we find a player so excited
              and dramatic about a League match like Tyler1 is. Now it could be
              all part of an act in front of his online audience. But then
              again, he might actually be this much invested in the game. For
              example, one of the videos on his youtube channel is titled
              \u201cTrying Not To Tilt While Reading Patch
              Notes\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              In that video, Tyler1 starts off with his usual rowdy-ruff style
              and after brief chit-chat, starts reading patch notes. With every
              sentence he reads, he reacts, and you can feel how energetic and
              frustrated he is while simply reading patch notes! This is also
              what makes him so entertaining and, at times, hilarious to
              watch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              As one Reddit user pointed out, he is just like everyone else but
              only more so. In other words, he gives expression to what we are
              all feeling while reading patch notes and playing League matches,
              but he does so in a very dramatized
              fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                <p>
                  As said earlier, Tyler1 is like all of us but only more so in
                  some ways. We all have had those matches where even the
                  coolest heads in League got close to Tilting. Sometimes you
                  are doing great in the laning phase, but one or two of your
                  teammates have been feeding the enemy team all along, and by
                  the time you get ready for team fights, it\u2019s already too
                  late. These kinds of matches can be a bit frustrating at
                  times. There is no excuse for toxicity but what Tyler1 does is
                  he acts like he has all his energy invested in that one match
                  and gives a reaction that can sometimes lead you to get
                  banned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  And since his reactions are outrageous and entertaining,
                  Tyler1 gets a lot of views.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                        <p>
                          Although Tyler1 never seems to lose popularity despite
                          his unconventional style, a word on the general
                          conduct of the League of Legends community deserves
                          mention here. Most of the streamers that stream League
                          of Legends are fairly decent people and do not
                          encourage nor exhibit toxic behavior while playing
                          League. You can find the most talented and calmest
                          League players losing matches and still be on their
                          best behavior. Tyler1, even though he has been banned
                          for a significant period of time, would not explicitly
                          condone toxic attitudes towards other players. It
                          might be part of an Act, after all. Any good streamer
                          will tell you that, since you are facing an audience
                          of potentially hundreds and thousands of people while
                          streaming, you have to put a certain face on during
                          online streams if you are the host of the stream.
                          Tyler1\u2019s antics are most likely part of that,
                          which might be the reason people like him so
                          much.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"
