    Kai\u2019Sa is incredibly potent at the moment.\u00a0Her ability to increase
    the attack speed through Supercharge gives her an opportunity to deal tons
    of damage in a blink of an eye.\u00a0The fact that she can also build AP
    makes her an even better ADC since building Armor against her won\u2019t be
    enough. While she requires some early game patience until she can get an
    item or two, Kai&#8217;Sa is one of the
    <strong

          Caitlyn has received some fairly impactful buffs in this patch.
          Although she is only getting +2 AD, this buff to an ADC has been
          common over the years and on average, shifts the win rate by around 1
          percent. +5 movement speed on any champion does the same. When
          combined, Caitlyn\u2019s early game is decently stronger with improved
          kiting, more poke, and more pushing power. The big thing stopping her
          from jumping too high is her matchups into Ashe and Jhin but if
          anything happens to them, expect Caitlyn to rise even
          more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
