Least Played Champions in League of Legends"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  In League of Legends, things are continuously changing, which isn\u2019t a bad
  thing. You have some champions being picked more than others, while other
  champions are consistent throughout and are never picked. When a champion is
  never picked, this is a sign that Riot should consider reworking the
  champion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              Taliya is one of the&nbsp;<strong
                >least played champs<\/strong>&nbsp;in League of Legends in the
                middle lane. According to our research, this LoL champion is
                found in about 0.31% of games, and at this time, her win-rate is
                very low. At the time of writing this,&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\"
                href=\"https:\/\/champion.gg\/champion\/Taliyah\/Middle\"
                rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Taliyah has a win rate of an average
                of 44.82%<\/a>&nbsp;&#8211; this is lower than most of the other
                champions. Taliyah was hit hard by nerfs, but I believe that

                      Annie \u2013 Support, has a low pick rate of 0.31% &#8211;
                      she\u2019s the champion with the lowest pick-rate,
                      actually. To us, this is a shock because we recall a point
                      in time when Annie was continuously picked, and she
                      dominated the bottom lane. We feel that the biggest issue
                      with Annie is the fact that she wasn\u2019t designed to be
                      a Support Champion, but they did it anyway. Annie
                      doesn\u2019t offer much for her ADC, except for a single
                      stun and high burst damage. She doesn\u2019t work great in
                      a meta where the carry needs more peel in the form of
                      health and shields.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong

                              those rolls, though. Heimerdinger can be found in
                              around 0.24 to 0.34% of the games \u2013 his
                              highest win rate is in the middle

                                      This is another champion in League of
                                      Legends that is the least played. In the
                                      Top lane, this champion is picked in
                                      around 0.38% of the games and is steadily
                                      declining over the past couple of patches.
                                      His win-rate is also pretty low, with a
                                      45.7% win-rate. He has been through a
                                      couple of reworks already, so what he
                                      needs now to make him a popular choice
                                      again would be a couple of

                                          declining, which is very unfortunate.
                                          He\u2019s picked in around 0.51% of
                                          games. His win rate is 47.2%, which is

                                          popular.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--nextpage-->\n\n\n\n

                                              played champions in League of
                                              Legends, we have Tahm Kench \u2013
                                              he\u2019s not played much in the
                                              support role. He\u2019s a good
                                              champion that can offer a lot of
                                              aid to the ADC. Unfortunately for
                                              Tahm Kench, though, it\u2019s not
                                              enough to make him a popular
                                              choice. He isn\u2019t able to
                                              offer any shields or heals and is
                                              stuck as a melee champion. Plus,
                                              he also takes up a lot of mana.
                                              Right now, his pick rate is
                                              0.47%.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
