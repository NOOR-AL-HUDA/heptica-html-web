5 Best Champions That Can Solo Baron"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  Everybody knows that objectives win games in League of Legends. It often
  doesn&#8217;t matter how many kills or assists you have &#8211; it only
  matters whether your team has collected the Dragons or slain Baron Nashor. The
  reason is that these monsters grant powerful buffs that are game-changing. So
  if you can take them alone, that&#8217;s a large bonus for your team. So, who
  are the best champions that can solo Baron in LoL?<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  Well, there are many of them, actually, and that&#8217;s for certain. Any
  champion that scales well in the late game and has tons of lifesteal can do
  the job. And any champion with &#8220;pets&#8221; that could tank the Baron
  while they deal damage is a good choice too. However, some picks are just
  extremely efficient at taking the Baron Nashor down, even alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  And in this post, we&#8217;ll only talk about the top 5 best champions that
  can solo Baron in League of Legends. These 5 picks have the highest damage
  compared to the other champions. And they can heal\/sustain themselves
  throughout the fight with Baron.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  So if you&#8217;d like to play a champion that can easily solo Baron in League
  and take it away from the enemy team, pick one of these 5!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

    <p>
      We can all agree that
      <strong
        >Master Yi <\/strong>is the best champion for soloing Baron in League,
        right? It seems like Yi&#8217;s ability kit was made precisely for
        taking down objectives in the jungle quickly and
        efficiently.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        <p>
          Ok, but why is Master Yi so good at taking down the Baron Nashor
          quickly? It&#8217;s because all of Yi&#8217;s damage is done through
          his basic attacks!&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, he&#8217;s got his E, Wuju Style. Once activated, Wuju
          Style makes Yi&#8217;s basic attacks deal bonus true damage, which is
          the best kind of damage in the game. Second, Yi&#8217;s ultimate
          grants so much attack speed that he doesn&#8217;t even need attack
          speed items. And third, Master Yi&#8217;s build is composed of items
          that give critical strike, lifesteal, attack speed, and damage &#8211;
          all crucial stats for soloing the Baron!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on how soon in the game Master Yi tries to take down the
          Baron by himself, he needs to use his W, Meditate too. This ability
          heals Yi for a significant amount, but it also blocks a lot of damage
          during its duration. Meditate often guarantees that Yi can solo the
          Baron, even if he is lower level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            ><strong
              >What should you build on Yi to quickly solo the
              Baron?<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n
              <p>
                Like I mentioned already, the most important stats are
                lifesteal, attack speed, damage, and crit. Naturally,
                you&#8217;ll want to have as much lifesteal and attack speed as
                possible, with damage and crit being less important for the
                Baron fight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
              </p>
              <p>
                This is because Yi already has enough damage thanks to his E.
                So, he only needs to keep his health up during the fight with
                Baron. And if his auto-attacks keep on healing him, he can
                easily solo it!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                      <p>
                        <strong
                          >Warwick<\/strong> is another champion that&#8217;s
                          efficient at taking down the Baron Nashor solo. He
                          might be even more efficient than Master Yi, simply
                          because of how tanky he is early on. It might take him
                          more time to slay the Baron on average, but he is also
                          more likely to succeed early on too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          <p>
                            Warwick doesn&#8217;t always go for an all-damage
                            build. And this allows him to have both damage and
                            defensive stats. When soloing Baron, Warwick can
                            last a lot longer than Yi, even without much
                            lifesteal. He can continually heal himself and block
                            a big portion of the Baron&#8217;s damage, and
                            that&#8217;s purely because of his
                            abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Let&#8217;s start with Warwick&#8217;s passive,
                            Eternal Hunger. This ability grants Warwick a ton of
                            lifesteal. It actually triples the amount he heals
                            with each basic attack when his health reaches 25%.
                            So even if Warwick doesn&#8217;t start the Baron
                            fight on full HP, he can still heal up and finish
                            the fight!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Next, we have Warwick&#8217;s Q, Jaws of the Beast.
                            This is a simple attack ability that deals up to 10%
                            max Health magic damage. It&#8217;s on a relatively
                            short cooldown, so Warwick can basically spam it
                            against the Baron. But the best part is that Jaws of
                            the Beast also heals Warwick for the same amount it
                            damages the target!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            And lastly, we have Warwick&#8217;s E, Primal Howl.
                            Primal Howl is a damage reduction effect that also
                            casts fear on nearby enemies. This doesn&#8217;t
                            work on the Baron Nashor, of course, but Warwick can
                            use it to block a lot of incoming
                            damage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            All in all, Warwick is a fantastic pick for taking
                            objectives around the map. And he&#8217;s one of the
                            best champions that can solo Baron in League of
                            Legends!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                In the third place, we have
                                <strong
                                  >Jax<\/strong>! Jax is an incredible champion
                                  for soloing jungle camps, champions, entire
                                  teams, and even Dragons and Barons! Like
                                  Master Yi, all of Jax&#8217;s damage comes
                                  from his basic attacks, which is the best
                                  source of damage for taking down the Nashor
                                  solo!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                  <p>
                                    One advantage that Jax has and Warwick and
                                    Yi don&#8217;t have is his E, Counterplay.
                                    Counter Strike isn&#8217;t a simple damage
                                    reduction spell like Yi&#8217;s W and
                                    Warwick&#8217;s E. It actually blocks 100%
                                    of the incoming attacks from the Baron
                                    during its duration! This is an extremely
                                    helpful effect to have in all stages of the
                                    game, but especially when you&#8217;re
                                    trying to take down the Baron
                                    early.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    Other than his Counter Strike, Jax has his
                                    ultimate, Grandmaster&#8217;s Might. Once
                                    used, Jax&#8217;s R gives him a ton of armor
                                    and magic resist. This buff can last through
                                    the whole fight with Baron, making Jax a
                                    very tanky champion. And thanks to it, he
                                    doesn&#8217;t need to have too much
                                    lifesteal in order to take the Baron

                                    Additionally, Jax has his Q, Leap Strike,
                                    and his W, Empower. Empower simply empowers
                                    his next basic attack to hit hard and deal a
                                    lot of damage. But his Q can be used to do
                                    some extra damage too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    What&#8217;s great about Jax&#8217;s Q and W
                                    is that he can use them between auto-attacks
                                    to reset the internal cooldown. So if you go
                                    basic attack, then Q, then basic attack,
                                    then W, then basic gain &#8211; you&#8217;ll
                                    squeeze a lot of extra damage in the
                                    shortest amount of time
                                    possible!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                    So, Jax is fantastic for taking down the
                                    Baron solo!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                          for him to take all objectives by
                                          himself, including the Baron
                                          Nashor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                          <p>
                                            Yasuo deals all critical strike
                                            damage, backed up by a lot of
                                            lifesteal and attack speed. Because
                                            of this, he usually does a lot more
                                            damage to the Baron than anyone on
                                            this list. Master Yi gets pretty
                                            close with his true damage, but
                                            Yasuo is just a damage-dealing
                                            machine in the late game, especially
                                            to non-player targets such as the
                                            Baron.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            You could say that at last a half of
                                            Yasuo&#8217;s abilities are useless
                                            against Nashor. And it&#8217;s true.
                                            His E doesn&#8217;t deal a lot of
                                            damage, and the Baron can&#8217;t be
                                            knocked up, so Yasuo can&#8217;t
                                            activate his ultimate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            However, Yasuo&#8217;s Q, Steel
                                            Tempest, can be used between basic
                                            attacks for extra damage. It always
                                            critically strikes, even as a
                                            tornado.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            Additionally, Yasuo can use his W,
                                            Wind Wall, to block the
                                            Baron&#8217;s attacks for a bit of
                                            time. Many players forget that the
                                            Baron is actually a ranged unit,
                                            which means that tools like
                                            Yasuo&#8217;s Wind Wall can block
                                            its basic attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            This becomes very important in games
                                            when Yasuo wants to take down the
                                            Baron early. In that case, he needs
                                            to use his W multiple times during
                                            the fight. And he shouldn&#8217;t
                                            forget to actually stand behind the
                                            wall!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                            That&#8217;s why Yasuo is one of the
                                            best champions that can solo Baron
                                            in League!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
