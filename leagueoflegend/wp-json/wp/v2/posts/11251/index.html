<p>
  eSports is very competitive \u2013 it&#8217;s an organized video gaming event
  where competitors from different teams (or leagues) come together and compete
  in the same games popular for at-home gamers. Games that are popular in the
  World of eSports include League of Legends, Fortnite, CounterStrike,
  Overwatch, Call of Duty, and Madden NFL. Millions of people watch the gamers
  competing throughout the World &#8211; these people can either attend the live
  events or tune in online. Streaming services such as <a
  href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/directory\/game\/League%20of%20Legends\"
  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitch<\/a> give viewers the
  opportunity to watch their favorite gamers play. Twitch is usually where
  popular gamers gain their fan following. The question I will cover today is
  how much money do Pro League of Legends players make?<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  LoL just so happens to be <a

  data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"6960\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
  noopener\">one of the most successful eSports in the World<\/a>, so it&#8217;s
  a great place to start if you&#8217;re looking to become a pro gamer. The game
  has a player base that is around 80 million, and as a result, the game offers
  some pretty high salaries. How are those LoL salaries determined?<\/p>\n\n\n\n

    <p>
      When you&#8217;re part of a successful business system, you will get a cut
      of the cake for playing your part. When you put it like that, this means
      that the excellent League of Legends players make a good amount of money
      simply for keeping millions of viewers glued to their screens by putting
      on a good show when they&#8217;re competing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      For those of you who are looking to make a big salary, another thing that
      would help would be to have the ability to make a difference. Like with
      any other sport, League of Legends tracks the player&#8217;s stats and his
      team&#8217;s results. Based on these findings, an evaluator can quickly
      figure out how good the player is relative to their peers. Kind of like
      how you can take one football player and compare him to another to
      determine which one out of the two is better (assuming they play the same
      position). ADCs should be put with ADCs, midlaners with midlaners, and so
      on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

            When taking a seat at the negotiations table, the agents or the
            players can talk about raw numbers and present individual stats,
            former team results, and overall popularity within the community.
            This will help determine how much the player is worth within the
            system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

            Using Faker as an example \u2013 for those of you who do not know,
            Fake is known for being one of the greatest players ever to touch
            LoL. He has won World&#8217;s multiple times and has dominated his
            region with T1 year after year. At the start of 2020, Faker received
            an order of $10 million from China and another blank check offer
            from North America \u2013 basically, he was asked to name his price.
            He turned down these offers, but the facts are there: when
            you&#8217;re a professional at something, and you&#8217;re a part of
            a successful business structure that is making money, it&#8217;s not
            hard to pull in your fair share.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                LCS is the North American League. In LCS, the minimum League of
                Legends salaries is around $75,000. For a gamer living in Europe
                or the USA, this is a lot of money. They bring in approximately
                $6,000 every month, and this doesn&#8217;t include the
                performance and tournament bonuses. The system is set up to
                allow the players to get paid a high amount of money, even if
                they&#8217;re not all that successful. This shows us that any
                individual that is competing in the LCS makes enough money to
                keep them playing professionally, even if other opportunities
                come their way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
              </p>
              <p>
                On average, the LoL salary for LCS is much more than $75,000. It
                has been revealed to be as high as $300,000. The best players
                are more than likely making three times this amount. So, if
                you&#8217;re worried that you&#8217;re not going to make a
                living playing video games, I wouldn&#8217;t be worried in the
                era we&#8217;re living in. As long as you&#8217;re really good
                at LoL and can reach a professional level, you can bring in that
                kind of money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          Just like with any other sports, LoL only has so much
                          room for teams and players, so not every single gamer
                          is going to make it. Take the big league as an
                          example; there are about 10 teams per league. This is
                          around 50 players plus some substitutes. So,
                          let&#8217;s say there are 70 players. In order to be a
                          well-paid professional esports athlete, you will need
                          to be super good at the game because there are
                          millions of people playing it. Even if you manage to
                          reach the <a

                          still be competing with thousands of players who are
                          also at that level and seeking a team for
                          themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          To truly succeed and become a pro-Lol player, you will
                          need to have an edge. That edge cannot pop out simply
                          by playing LoL all day because everyone who is at that
                          level plays League of Legends all day. Instead, you
                          have to stand out from the crowd \u2013 have a mixture
                          of personality traits that will make you a good team
                          player so that teams can see that you&#8217;re a solid
                          investment. It also has to come from professional
                          analytical skills as well as training methods.
                          I&#8217;m saying that it isn&#8217;t how many hours or
                          days you have players, but rather how you manage to
                          improve during the hours you play.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          Gaming is a mixture of problem-solving and
                          strategizing. All of which depends on the quality of
                          your thinking. Like an RPG, a mage will rely upon the
                          intellect to cast those spells; your mind depends on a
                          similar trait when you&#8217;re analyzing situations
                          and finding the best route for going from point A to
                          point B. If you&#8217;re not able to do this,
                          you&#8217;re not going to be that good at gaming.
                          Actually, the best LoL players are the ones that can
                          easily do this. These can be gained by studying
                          concepts such as strategy, critical thinking,
                          problem-solving, game theory, and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
