5 Best Ranged Top Laners In Season 11"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  The top lane is usually reserved for big melee bruisers, but some other
  Champion classes can fit the role from time to time. These can be control
  mages like Gangplank, or they can be your good ol\u2019 ranged AP or AD
  carry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  In this list, we have compiled the 5 Best ranged Top Laners in the current
  meta. We will go over their strengths and weaknesses, when you should pick
  them, and against whom. If done correctly, the ranged top laner can easily
  dominate melee opponents, prompting their jungler to remain dormant and
  opening other lanes up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

      Vayne will appear in just about any list of this type, and rightfully so.
      She has been the go-to marksman pick for top laners for a few seasons now.
      Her strong passive W can pierce through all defenses with ease, especially
      when combined with the
      <strong
        >Press the Attack <\/strong>rune, making her a three-shot
        beast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        <p>
          Her passive does not end there, as it actually does damage based on
          max hp, therefore making her a fantastic pick against immobile tanks
          such as Ornn.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          She will remain strong and only get stronger as the game progresses,
          giving your team a massive boost in dishing out AD damage and
          replacing your ADC that may die early in the fight.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Watch out for fast and dueling top picks like Jax or Aatrox, as they
          can quickly close gaps and keep you slowed\/stunned for long enough to
          be swiftly taken care of. Despite your E and Q, which can often be
          lifesaving, Vayne should avoid facing fast duelists and be reserved
          for easy, immovable targets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                  This one is likely debatable, as you will not often see
                  Kai\u2019sa picked in the top lane. But why did I choose to
                  include it in this list?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Well, first off, it is one of my favorite Champions to play as
                  a Top main. Her kit is overloaded and incredibly versatile,
                  allowing for dishing out fast and enormous hybrid damage to
                  enemies of all kinds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  She is good against most tanks and many fighters, and being a
                  hybrid AP-ADC, she will <a

                  rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">snowball<\/a> like no tomorrow,
                  providing your team with incredible long-range damage and
                  rapid close-range engages.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like Vayne, Jax and similar fast gap closing fighters are her
                  main problem in the top lane, but against more manageable
                  targets, she will excel with ease. The enemy jungler will
                  likely focus on you, so better watch out for
                  that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                        <p>
                          Our first true AP champion (though playable in hybrid
                          and AD mode) is Teemo. Teemo is a classic Top laner
                          and has been for years. He changed through roles a
                          lot, and you can often find him in mid or support, but
                          Top is where he shines the most.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          He is the go-to counter to all other ranged AD
                          Champions (and those fast-hitting melees like Master
                          Yi and Tryndamere). The shrooms can protect you from
                          ganks and other interference. They also give you small
                          vision around them, which will keep you alert for any
                          invasion happening. If any does happen, your W is a
                          valuable speed boost for a safe retreat to your
                          tower.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Teemo can snowball fast and easy, enabling him to
                          chunk a third (or more) of the enemy\u2019s health bar
                          with a single well-planted shroom. His Q allows him to
                          isolate ADCs and other vital auto-attacking enemies,
                          making or breaking an entire fight and\/or
                          game.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Teemo is an all-rounded Champion, good against almost
                          every pick you can find but fails to beat Champions
                          which rely heavily on spells other than pure attacks
                          such as Yorick and his ghouls or Jayce and his lethal
                          combos.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          The runes I usually take vary from match up to match
                          up, so hitting up some of our guides on the site can
                          be helpful to determine what to take and

                                      His trade is usually excellent as he can
                                      keep a medium distance and poke with his
                                      root and five-finger shock for massive
                                      damage. The Ultimate is one more weapon of
                                      mass destruction that Swain has, which can
                                      keep him fighting for long periods of
                                      time. In fact, the longer the fight goes
                                      on, the stronger he gets, so watch out for
                                      not dragging it for too

                                      Swain is not too strong early on, but he
                                      only gets stronger and then some as the
                                      game progresses. He can grow into a
                                      massive AP tank capable of standing amidst
                                      five enemy players who will struggle to
                                      kill him, even when applying

                                                      But it is for this exact

                                                      fighting. If the enemy is
                                                      a robust, fast, and gap
                                                      closing fighter, you can
                                                      opt for the ranged stance,
                                                      which will allow you to
