  Prior to the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"

  patch 8.23<\/a>, Adaptive Force was added to the secondary Rune path. Adaptive
  Force (a phrase we\u2019re sure you have heard in LoL) is an additional boost
  or stat. Riot Games added these extra stats so that League of Legends players
  would have more options that they could choose from.<strong
    >&nbsp;The extra stats include cooldown reduction, bonus attack speed,
    additional defense stats, and adaptive damage.&nbsp;<\/strong><a

      <p>
        Adaptive Force gives an LoL champion either ability power (AP), or bonus
        attack damage (AD) \u2013 what is granted to you all depends on which
        damage type your chosen champion has more of.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
      </p>
      <p>Let me give you an example:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n</p>
      <p>
        <strong
          ><em
            >Let\u2019s say you chose Adaptive Force on Kennen with Doran\u2019s
            blade (his starting item) \u2013 this will give you a stronger boost
            attack in damage. Why is this? Because this champion has more attack
            damage than ability power.&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n
            <p>
              If you would have chosen Gankplank instead, and picked
              Doran\u2019s ring as the starting item, then your ability power
              would outnumber your attack damage. Since you have less attack
              damage than ability power, this means that Adaptive Force is going
              to give you a bonus to your ability power.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Riot Games has mentioned that Adaptive Force is either going to
              increase your champions ability power or attack power, depending
              on the champions you choose as well as the items you purchased in
              the beginning.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <h2>
              How Does Adaptive Force in LoL Work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n
              <p>
                One point of Adaptive Force compares to one point of AP and 0.6
                points of bonus attack damage. What does all of this mean? Well,
                for every one point of Adaptive Force you gain, this means that
                you will earn 0.6 points AD and one point AP.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
              </p>
              <p>
                When you pick Adaptive Force in the first Stat Share rows, this
                will give your champion the ability to attack that Adaptive
                Force, which will result in either 20 bonus AP or 12 bonus
                AD.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                  Adaptive Force does as the name suggests \u2013 it adapts to
                  the items you have throughout the match. In League of Legends,
                  it is crucial that you build your runes so that they are
                  aligned with the items you have chosen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, let\u2019s say that you\u2019re in mid-game, you
                  gain more AD than you do AP. This will result in your Adaptive
                  Force increasing whichever state you have more
                  buffed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>

                  their Stat Shard, here\u2019s a list of runes and items they
                  could use to improve those force bonuses:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
