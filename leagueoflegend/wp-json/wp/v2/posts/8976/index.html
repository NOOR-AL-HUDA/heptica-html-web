      I remember back in 2010 when Irelia was released \u2013 as soon as she
      emerged, I had to give her a try. In Top lane, Irelia just so happens to
      be one of the most popular melee champions, and she has that sweet
      innocent look to her, so it&#8217;d be crazy not to include her on this
      list. Eight years after her release, Irelia went through a rework phase,
      and from there, she became even more popular with her practical stun and
      dash kit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      Irelia helped defeat the Noxian invaders, and for this reason, she&#8217;s
      a hero of Ionia. To the Ionian people, Irelia is symbolic, and to us,
      she&#8217;s one of the hottest League of Legends champions!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          Fiora is another champion that earned her spot on our
                          list of the hottest LoL champions! She was released
                          years ago, in 2012, and is a well-known melee champion
                          in the top lane, sitting right next to Irelia. Fiora
                          is head of the Demacian noble house of House
                          Laurent.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                          then you probably already know why we included her on
                          this list of the most appealing LoL female champions
                          of 2020 \u2013 her most attractive skins, in our

                          Headmistress, and of course, Pool Party. While Fiora
                          is attractive, Riot Games didn&#8217;t set out to

                                              Kindred is an anthropomorphic
                                              animal character, but it has human
                                              characteristics and personalities,
                                              and we just had to include it on
                                              this list. It was released five
                                              years ago, in 2015, and in season
                                              6 all the way to season 8; it was
                                              one of the hottest picks.
                                              It&#8217;s a strong LoL champion
                                              early to mid-game, but
                                              unfortunately, we can&#8217;t find
                                              many players that choose it
                                              anymore. We believe this could be
                                              because of its statistics combined
                                              with her marksman skillset. For
                                              whatever reason, we still had to
                                              include Kindred on this list of
                                              the hottest League of Legends
                                              champions of 2021 because we feel
                                              it deserves some love from the LoL
