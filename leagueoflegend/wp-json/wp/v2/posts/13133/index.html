  champions to carry games<\/a> with. But Draven isn&#8217;t a self-sufficient
  champion and he lacks many important elements, such as mobility and
  defensiveness. And that&#8217;s where the best supports for Draven come into
  play!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  Draven should be and often is the bully in the bot lane. He prefers supports
  that are either hyper-aggressive or champions that can protect him while
  he&#8217;s being aggressive. But there are clear winners in both of these
  categories, so let&#8217;s talk about the top 7 best supports for Draven in
  season 11 of League of Legends!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

    <p>
      Thresh is one of the most popular supports in League of Legends. But he is
      also one of the best champions to play in combination with Draven. Almost
      all of the tools that Thresh brings to the table can in some way enhance
      Draven&#8217;s performance. So let&#8217;s examine them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most notable things about Thresh is his <a
      href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions\/\"
      data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8923\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
      noopener\">crowd control<\/a>. His long-range Q can catch enemies off
      guard and help Thresh bounce them back with E or slow them down with R.
      This allows Draven to continually hit their opponents until they die. One
      of the biggest weaknesses of Draven is the inability to <a
      href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends\/\"
      data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"9722\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
      noopener\">CC<\/a> targets, so Thresh solves that in a way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      But Thresh has one more key thing &#8211; his lantern. This is one of the
      best mobility spells that a support champion can offer to his allies. The
      lantern helps Draven escape sticky situations or quickly reach his
      targets. These two champions can play very aggressively as long as the
      Thresh player is experienced in landing hooks and throwing lanterns in the
      right spots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

            <p>
              Blitzcrank and Draven have a very similar playstyle to Thresh and
              Draven. But Blitzcrank is a much simpler champion than his support
              rival so the combo between him and Draven is way easier to
              execute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, the easiest way to get a kill as Blitzcrank and
              Draven is to pull someone towards you with Q and knock him up with
              E. This is enough crowd control for any stage of the game, simply
              because of how much damage Draven can do. And you can repeat this
              process throughout the match.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Many players agree that Blitz has an advantage over Thresh when
              supporting Draven because his Q displaces the target, rather than
              locking him into place. Any champion that can bring squishy
              targets to Draven and hold them down is a good support, but Blitz
              simply excels at it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              And let&#8217;s not forget Blitzcrank&#8217;s ultimate. His
              silence is another form of CC because it also stops champions from
              using Flash too. All in all, Blitz is one of the best supports to
              choose whenever you see Draven locked in a solo
              queue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                    <p>
                      Nami isn&#8217;t anywhere near to Thresh or Blitz in terms
                      of playstyle, but she can aid Draven in different ways.
                      Remember, Draven can also be paired with supportive
                      champions, such as Soraka, Janna, or Lulu. But Nami is
                      simply the best for supporting him in
                      particular.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The most important thing that Nami brings to this combo is
                      her heal. This is both a defensive and an offensive
                      ability since the healing wave bounces off both allies and
                      enemies. Experienced Nami players will always look to
                      damage enemies while healing their allies. And since
                      Draven doesn&#8217;t have any poke damage except his
                      auto-attacks, this is great for trading early on in
                      lane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But Nami also offers two different knock-up effects. Both
                      her Q and R have considerably long range and can be used
                      for either engaging or disengaging.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      And the last thing that not too many players abuse as Nami
                      is her E ability. Whenever used, this spell enhances the
                      next 3 attacks of herself or her chosen allies. These 3
                      attacks deal bonus damage, but also apply a slow effect on
                      the enemy for 1 second. You can clearly see why this is a
                      huge benefit for Draven in any type of
                      scenario.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                        <p>
                          When talking about locking down an enemy in place, few
                          can do it as well as Leona. Her E Q combo is quite
                          lengthy. Add in her ultimate after reaching level 6
                          and your target will not stand a chance, Draven will
                          have too much freedom to deal absurd amounts of damage
                          to a target that will not even be able to trade
                          back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          A really good added bonus is that Leona is inherently
                          very tanky thanks to her W. There&#8217;s almost no
                          way the enemy can hope to burst her down, and given
                          her Q has a relatively low cooldown, extended trades
                          would be heavily beneficial for the Draven and Leona
                          duo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                              Draven likes being aggressive, but he doesn\u2019t
                              have the biggest of ranges, meaning he often finds
                              himself getting slapped back when he goes in to
                              poke a bit. Soraka will help mitigate any sort of
                              damage Draven receives in such
                              trades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                              Another sweet trading tool Soraka brings to the
                              table is her silence. This will block enemy
                              champions from using any abilities, meaning hard
                              engage supports such as Pyke or even Pantheon will
                              not be able to jump on top of either laner as long
                              as they are inside the abilities area of

                                      Well, we did just say he was a hard
                                      engaging support right? Draven loves this
                                      type of company, as it helps him get into
                                      fights more often. Pyke is sort of a more
                                      aggressive, damage-heavy hooking support,
                                      so while he does not really have much
                                      utility such as Thresh\u2019s lantern, for
                                      example, Pyke does excel at dealing damage
                                      and bursting down squishies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                      His ultimate is fantastic as well, it is
                                      an execute that gives the full amount of
                                      kill gold to whoever was the most recent
                                      ally to damage the enemy and get the
                                      assist. This gets even better because this
                                      stacks with Draven\u2019s passive. You
                                      read that right, should an enemy die to
                                      this duo, Pyke\u2019s R will grant Draven
                                      the full amount of gold from the kill, and
                                      Draven himself will have his passive
                                      triggered, making this duo a phenomenal
                                      gold snowball.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                          I guess we can summarize and say
                                          Draven quite enjoys a support that has
                                          a hook. Similar to the hooking
                                          supports above, Nautilus has good
                                          engage potential and can lock a target
                                          down for Draven to fling axes at the
                                          target.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                          His point and click ult serves as a
                                          fantastic initiation tool, especially
                                          if Nautilus is able to follow up with
                                          his Q and passive root. As a natural
                                          tank, Nautilus is able to soak up a
                                          lot of retaliation damage for
                                          Draven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
