to Counter Vex? The Best Counter Tips To Beat Vex in Season
11"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  Vex, the all-new champion that just got released in Season 11, was designed to
  completely shut down hypermobile champions dominating as of late, punishing
  every dash and flash that she sees in the field. Aside from that, she has the
  standard burst mage power that can delete every <a

  touch. If she kills someone after using her ultimate, she gets to recast it
  again, allowing her to <a

  champion in the game, she can still be countered with the right tips and
  champions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

  Before proceeding to detail how to counter the latest yordle on the Rift,
  let\u2019s go on and understand her kit first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

      <li>
        <strong
          >Passive &#8211; Doom \u2018n Gloom<\/strong> &#8211; The first part
          of her passive, Doom, periodically empowers her basic abilities to
          fear enemies that get hit. The second part of her passive marks nearby
          enemies who blink or dash with Gloom. Vex\u2019s next basic attack and
          some of her basic abilities consume this mark to deal extra magic
          damage and refund Doom\u2019s cooldown.<\/li>

            <strong
              >Q &#8211; Mistral Bolt<\/strong> &#8211; Vex releases a wide wave
              of mist to the target direction that accelerates but reduces in
              width after a short while, dealing damage to all enemies hit. This
              ability consumes Gloom.<\/li>

                  ability consumes Gloom.<\/li>

                      >E &#8211; Looming Darkness<\/strong> &#8211; Vex commands
                      Shadow to the target location, slowing and dealing damage
                      to enemies upon arrival.<\/li>

                          Shadow to launch itself in the target direction,
                          dealing damage to all enemies hit. Upon hitting a
                          champion, the champion is marked with Gloom, and Vex
                          can recast this ability to dash to that champion. If
                          the marked champion dies within 12 seconds, Vex can
                          recast Shadow Surge at no additional cost for the next

                                        The resident vampire champion, Vladimir,
                                        is a great counter to the gloomy yordle.
                                        His abilities allow him to have some
                                        sustain to keep up with Vex\u2019s poke
                                        and harass. His Sanguine Pool is also
                                        very crucial in helping him evade a good
                                        amount of Vex\u2019s damage when she
                                        starts her combo. Come mid to late game,
                                        Vladimir\u2019s burst damage is greater
                                        than Vex\u2019s, and Vladimir becomes
                                        more of a bigger threat than Vex as he
                                        scales better. By focusing on
                                        teamfights, Vladimir easily gains an
                                        advantage over Vex.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                            similar kit design to Vex. However,
                                            this little girl has shown to win
                                            out the match-up because Annie has a
                                            longer auto-attack range than Vex,
                                            allowing Annie to stay away from
                                            Vex, who mostly has short-range

                                            her movement speed that allows her

                                                counters, this time coming from

                                                artillery mage, Xerath. As an
                                                artillery mage, Xerath has few
                                                to no problems poking Vex from a
                                                very safe distance. The immobile
                                                Vex will have a hard time
                                                dodging all the Arcanopulses and

                                                competent Xerath will send
                                                toward the yordle\u2019s way. If

                                                Shocking Orb can stop her right
                                                away, then Xerath can again drop
