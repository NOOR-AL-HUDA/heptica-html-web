  There are various kinds of disables in League of Legends. These include stuns,
  suppression, silences, slows, fear, and more. Each one can be equally
  frustrating if you get caught in them and equally fun if you manage to get
  your enemies caught in them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

  League of Legends has a knack for a very smooth learning curve for new players
  but has layers of depth in the game that pro-players are still discovering,
  exploring, and talking about. New players find it easy to learn League of
  Legends, whereas pro players have lots of opportunities to explore new
  mechanics in the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

  Some players have alleged that smite can be used while being stunned.
  Similarly, others have argued that summoner spells can be used while being
  stunned; the logic there is that stuns work on the champion but not on the
  summoner or player (YOU!), so summoner spells are safe to use while being
  stunned. Another debate that can be found on Reddit and other chat forums is
  whether or not you can use smite while under the effect of Zhonya&#8217;s
  active.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

<p>
  Then again, the summoner spell that is possible to be used under a stun
  actually varies from spell to spell. The same is true for all the different
  kinds of disables i.e. the summoner spell that can be cast while under the
  effect of a particular disable depends on the disabling effect as well as the
  summoner spell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

  There could be an entire article about how to get free from different kinds of
  stuns. For example, Silence stops Flash and Teleport but not others. As far as
  the possibility of using Smite while being stunned is concerned, you can try
  it for yourself. Many users have said that it&#8217;s entirely possible to use
  smite while under the effect of stun.

      But such is the beauty of League of Legends. There are so many layers to
      this game that it&#8217;s safe to say they have not yet been explored
      entirely. As the game develops from season to season, new game mechanics
      are evolving, and there is more and more to explore in
      League.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"
