5 Safest Top Lane Picks in Season 11"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  It&#8217;s tough to stay safe in the top lane in season 11, isn&#8217;t it?
  There are so many champions that deal an insane amount of damage right from
  the early game. It seems like even a single mistake can set you so far behind
  that it&#8217;s almost impossible to come back. But whenever the meta becomes
  so punishing, we prefer to play safe champions to counter it. So, who are the
  safest top lane picks in season 11 of League of Legends?<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  Well, you got your regular tanks and your ranged champions. Picks such as
  Darius, Camille, or Aatrox, are not great candidates for this, simply because
  they&#8217;re fighters. You&#8217;ll likely be trading with your lane opponent
  much more on Irelia than you would on Poppy. So, it&#8217;s better to go a
  defensive champion or at least a champion that can farm from a distance if you
  want to stay safe in the top lane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  Now let&#8217;s check the top 5 safest top lane picks in season
  11!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

    <p>
      <strong
        >Shen <\/strong>is easily the safest top lane pick in the game. He is an
        extremely defensive champion right from level one, so he doesn&#8217;t
        struggle in the lane at all. And if you&#8217;re up against an
        experienced Shen player, there is nothing you can do to slay him,
        really.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        <p>
          Let&#8217;s analyze Shen for a moment. His passive Ki Barrier is a
          super useful effect that&#8217;s ideal for tanks. It grants Shen a
          shield every time he uses any of his active abilities. In other words,
          Shen is shielded pretty much all the time, no matter
          what.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Shen has his W, Spirit&#8217;s Refuge. This ability
          creates another shield around Shen that blocks all spells and attacks
          for nearly 2 seconds. It also doesn&#8217;t matter whether
          that&#8217;s Urgor&#8217;s R or Vayne&#8217;s auto-attacks &#8211;
          Spirit&#8217;S Refuge will block everything while it
          lasts!<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          But the best part about this ability is the fact that it&#8217;s an <a
          href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/aoe-damage\/\" data-type=\"post\"
          data-id=\"10434\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer
          noopener\">AoE<\/a> effect too. This means that Shen can not only keep
          himself safe but also his teammates. Spirit&#8217;s Refuge is pretty
          useful in 2v2 skirmishes with his jungler, so it&#8217;s
          super-valuable too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, Shen has his E, Shadow Dash. And Shadow Dash isn&#8217;t
          just a simple movement spell. It also taunts the enemy, making them
          unable to cast spells in return. Shen can use this ability anytime the
          enemy jungler comes, or his lane opponent is too aggressive. It almost
          guarantees the escape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>
        <p>
          And lastly, we have Shen&#8217;s R, Stand United. You don&#8217;t
          often see Shen players casting this ability to get away from trouble
          simply because it requires them to stand still for a few seconds.
          It&#8217;s much more helpful for saving teammates around the map. But
          you can count it as a safety tool for Shen too, since it teleports him
          away from the top lane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        </p>

            <p>
              You never really see Ornn feed that hard in the top lane, right?
              Well, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s really hard to fail on Ornn.
              He&#8217;s got everything he needs to succeed in the role and
              survive the laning phase with a breeze.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Let&#8217;s start with his passive. Ornn&#8217;s Living Forge
              effect makes him one of the most unique champions in League of
              Legends. He is currently the only pick who can purchase items
              without having to be in the base.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Once Ornn has enough gold for a certain item, whether that&#8217;s
              a part like Ruby Crystal or a completion like Sunfire Cape, he can
              simply buy it while in the lane. Of course, he can&#8217;t do it
              while fighting with enemy players, but he can as soon as he is out
              of combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, this may not seem like a safe tool but think about it. If you
              can always be an item up over your lane opponent, you lower your
              risks significantly. Ornn almost always has more HP, armor, or
              magic resist than his enemies, so he&#8217;s pretty safe when
              trading with them in the lane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, Ornn has his W, Bellows Breath. This is a fantastic
              ability because it turns Ornn immune to ant <a
              href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/longest-cc-abilities\/\"
              data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"11546\" target=\"_blank\"
              rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">crowd control spells<\/a>. And he can
              use it to avoid any potential lockdown whenever the enemy jungler
              comes to gank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              Ornn&#8217;s E is a simple dash that launches him in the chosen
              direction. It&#8217;s a handy ability to have, especially against
              aggressive enemies, because you can use it to disengage at any
              time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              And finally, Ornn&#8217;s R can be used to stop any engagement
              from the enemy. It&#8217;s a knock-up that also applies a slow
              effect, allowing Ornn to quickly get away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              That&#8217;s why Ornn is one of the safest top lane picks in
              season 11!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                    <p>
                      If you&#8217;ve seen even a few professional League of
                      Legends games, then you&#8217;ve probably seen that<strong>
                        Gnar <\/strong>is a highly contested pick there. This
                        isn&#8217;t impacted by the current meta nor the matchup
                        in the lane. Why so?<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        <p>
                          Well, Gnar is simply the best champion to never die in
                          the top lane. Unlike most of the top laners, he is
                          ranged, and he is pretty tanky. He alternates between
                          two phases, from Mini Gnar to Mega Gnar and from Mega
                          Gnar back to Mini Gnar. This lets him do pretty much
                          everything in the lane while also being super
                          safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          And so, Gnar can play pretty aggressively while in his
                          Mini Gnar form. He&#8217;s safe because the enemy top
                          laner can&#8217;t really reach him. Gnar&#8217;s
                          boomerang also applies slow, so he can keep any melee
                          top laner away from him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In Mega form, Gnar is almost unkillable. His HP
                          doubles, and his damage is insane. He can stun people
                          as well, so even if the jungler comes to gank him,
                          it&#8217;s unlikely that he&#8217;ll
                          succeed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          One of the things that&#8217;s really great about Gnar
                          is that he has his jump in both forms. When he is Mini
                          Gnar, he can double jump for double the distance if he
                          lands on top of a target the first time. This is an
                          incredible tool for escaping, especially ganks. For
                          example, jumping on the enemy jungler will launch you
                          at a great distance, allowing you to run
                          away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In any way, Gnar is a fantastic champion to main. It
                          doesn&#8217;t require too much skill, and he&#8217;s a
                          safe option against any pick in the top
                          lane!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                >Garen<\/strong> is another champion
                                that&#8217;s incredibly tough to shut down in
                                the top lane. He doesn&#8217;t require a genius
                                to understand how his passives work, so he is
                                one of our recommended picks for learning the
                                top lane role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                <p>
                                  Alright, the biggest reason why Garen is such
                                  a safe pick is his passive, Perseverance. This
                                  is a fantastic effect to have if you&#8217;re
                                  struggling against aggressive opponents.
                                  Perseverance regenerates Garen&#8217;s lost
                                  health whenever he is out of
                                  combat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  So, any time the enemy top laner chunks your
                                  HP and leaves you vulnerable, you can simply
                                  distance yourself until you&#8217;re back to
                                  full HP. For example, you can stand near your
                                  ranged minions and give up on a bit of a farm.
                                  In return, you&#8217;ll be healthy enough to
                                  play safely again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  But that&#8217;s not all. Garen&#8217;s next
                                  great tool is his W, Courage. Many low elo
                                  players don&#8217;t know exactly how to use
                                  this ability, even though it&#8217;s really
                                  OP. Courage reduces up to 70% of the incoming
                                  damage when it&#8217;s activated. It lasts for
                                  a short duration, only a second, but
                                  it&#8217;s very effective.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  Typically, you should use Courage when the
                                  enemy is blowing his strongest cooldowns. This
                                  will give you an advantage and keep you
                                  healthier than usual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                  And lastly, we have Garen&#8217;s Q, Decisive
                                  Strike. Even though this ability isn&#8217;t
                                  technically a safety tool, you can use it to
                                  disable your enemies. While they&#8217;re
                                  silent, you can either Flash away or simply
                                  outrun them. Use it to stop their damage, and
                                  you&#8217;ll be pretty safe!<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                            >Jayce<\/strong>! He&#8217;s got a
                                            fantastic ability kit for torturing
                                            enemy top laners, so he is
                                            definitely worth your
                                            time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                                            <p>
                                              What makes Jayce an exceptional
                                              pick in the top lane is his
                                              versatility. Not only can he farm
                                              safely from a distance, but he can
                                              also change into melee form and
                                              burst the target down. Not too
                                              many top laners are willing to
                                              trade with Jayce early on, so he
                                              always has a safe laning
                                              phase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                            <p>
                                              Jayce doesn&#8217;t have any
                                              defensive ability. No shield, no
                                              heals, and no barriers. However,
                                              he&#8217;s got a lot of movement
                                              speed. Every time he switches his
                                              weapon, he also gets a burst of MS
                                              that he can use to get away from
                                              the enemy. His E in ranged form,
                                              Acceleration Gate, also grants
                                              movement speed, so he&#8217;s
                                              never really in
                                              trouble.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                              Additionally, Jayce&#8217;s E in
                                              melee form, Thundering Blow,
                                              knocks enemies back. He can use it
                                              to gain distance from his pursuer,
                                              so it&#8217;s another way to keep
                                              himself safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                              But the key here is Jayce&#8217;s
                                              range. You should definitely take
                                              advantage of it and never allow
                                              the enemy top laner to reach you
                                              unless you&#8217;re going for the
                                              kill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                              And that&#8217;s pretty much it.
                                              Those are the top 5 safest top

                                              isn&#8217;t it? There are so many

                                              early game. It seems like even a
