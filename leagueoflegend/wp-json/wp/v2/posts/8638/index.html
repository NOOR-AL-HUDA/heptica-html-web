<p>
  League of Legends is a popular MOBA-type game that has been running strong
  since 2009 (that\u2019s over a decade). Over the years, this game has made its
  way into the homes of millions of gamers throughout the world. Some of those
  gamers even managed to make it to the pro-scene, where they earned thousands
  of dollars, along with respect and fame in the gaming
  community.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

      well over 100 million. Every month, 120 million Summoners play the game,
      and around 30 million are playing daily. It\u2019s not unusual to come
      across League streamers and content creators who have millions of
      subscribers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

      Looking at the stats, it doesn\u2019t seem like the player count is

          Here, we have popular games such as Fortnite and Overwatch gaining a
          reputation in the eSports\/gaming industry. With this thought in mind,
          there is a question that frequently pops up in the <a

              Has the game lost its reputation it once had? Does it still have
              its touch, or have gamers made their way to other games? With all

                  League of Legends isn\u2019t even dying down! The player base

                                              Emotions always play a role,

                                              emotions might just be why LoL is
                                              so popular. It\u2019s a love\/hate
                                              relationship, but somehow, the
                                              game still manages to give us
                                              feelings that are unparalleled
                                              with another game in the industry.

                                              the moment you get that revenge
