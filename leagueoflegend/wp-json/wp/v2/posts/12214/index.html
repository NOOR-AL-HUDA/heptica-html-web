  Viewership on Twitch continues to improve every year, and in recent months the
  platform experienced growth rates never seen before, notably after the global
  COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, Twitch accounted for more than 18 billion hours
  watched, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 65 percent. Not
  even the Fortnite boom, led by Ninja in 2018, caused the same level of
  growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
</p>
<p>
  For years now, the \u201cJust Chatting\u201d category has dominated the
  content available on Twitch, especially since the pandemic started, as it
  offered new opportunities for personalities outside of the gaming world to put
  out content online. In July 2021, the category totaled more than 240 million
  hours watched, with an average viewership of more than 320,000
  spectators.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

<p>
  In this article, we\u2019ll take a look at the most popular categories related
  to gameplay streaming, based on stats provided by <a

  July, and the preeminent streamers and personalities in each one of these

      The latest entry in one of the most popular video game franchises ever,
      Grand Theft Auto V was released almost 8 years ago, yet, the game is still
      very popular, and has been the second most-watched Twitch category for the
      last few months, only behind \u201cJust Chatting\u201d. It\u2019s
      important to notice that in April, the GTA V category <a
      href=\"https:\/\/dotesports.com\/streaming\/news\/gta-v-dethrones-just-chatting-as-twitchs-most-popular-category-for-a-couple-of-weeks\">surpassed
      \u201cJust Chatting\u201d<\/a> in total hours watched, thanks to many
      events related to GTA V RP, a mod that allows players to gather in one
      server and roleplay in the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      In July, GTA streams accounted for over 140 million hours watched, with an
      average of 190,000 viewers and 3,151 channels. Currently, the most popular
      English-speaking GTA V streamers are buddha, with more than 4 million
      hours watched, and <a
      href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/ratedepicz\">RatedEpicz<\/a>, with over 3
      million. However, the leading GTA streamer in July is from Brazil,
      loud_coringa, who accounted for more than 12 million hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              First-person shooters are arguably the most popular video games
              today, and that couldn\u2019t be different on Twitch. With titles
              such as Valorant and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive ranking
              among the most-watched Twitch categories, the genre is certainly
              trending in the platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              The free-to-play hero shooter by Riot Games, by the way, was the
              fourth most-watched category in July, with 80 million hours and an
              average of 108,703 viewers, largely due to the many Valorant
              Champions Tour Challengers events that took place last month.
              Counter-Strike: Global Offensive didn\u2019t achieve such
              expressive numbers, however, the game still accounted for almost
              60 million hours watched.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
            </p>
            <p>
              ShahZaM was the most popular English-speaking Valorant streamer in
              July, with over 2,7 million hours watched, followed by Michael

                  Building games like Minecraft and Roblox are still very
                  popular among gamers of all ages, and exciting upcoming titles
                  like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sandbox.game\/en\/\"
                  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The
                  Sandbox<\/a>, of which developers are continuously streaming
                  tutorials and guides, certainly helped bump the genre in
                  streaming rankings. Combining all titles, building games
                  totaled more than 70 million hours watched.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even though it was released almost 10 years ago, in November
                  2011, Minecraft alone accounted for 53 million hours, with an
                  average of almost 72,000 viewers and 3,791 channels. The game
                  is still a popular choice, especially among streamers outside
                  the United States, with millions of hours streamed in Italian,
                  French, Korean, and Portuguese. RanbooLive and Philza were the
                  most-watched Minecraft streamers in July, both with almost 2

                          Legends, multiplayer online battle arenas are arguably

                          tournaments and leagues. According to Esports Charts,
                          League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2 ranked
