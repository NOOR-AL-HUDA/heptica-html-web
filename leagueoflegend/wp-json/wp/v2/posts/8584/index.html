        impact on the gaming community. Do you feel that you have turned into a
        toxic player? Have you recently had your account chat restricted or
        found yourself arguing in the game?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        <p>
          The first step to quitting is to first admit what you have become.

              Before we go any further, we first want to let you know that we
              sympathize with you. It can be hard to just sit there on the
              sidelines and watch someone that is \u201csoft inting\u201d or
              trolling. You must continue to sit on the sidelines and refrain
              from typing to them because this isn\u2019t going to help people
              like that, and in all actuality,&nbsp;<strong

                      Perhaps you should disable chat and just stick to
                      yourself. When people are competing together, they\u2019re
                      going to do whatever they can to disturb
                      you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                        not be toxic within themselves, but they are put there
                        to get a reaction out of you and cause you to get off
                        your game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        <p>
                          If you\u2019re the type of person triggered by people
                          who make these remarks in League of Legends, you
                          should disable all chat so that you cannot see what
                          the enemy is saying to you \u2013 this will help
                          eliminate the toxicity. Not only will this cause you
                          not to type something toxic back to them, but it will
                          also prevent you from getting off your game. By
                          disabling chat, you will be able to put all of your
                          focus towards your gameplay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                              Personally, we feel that disabling all chat is a
                              great thing to do as it will prevent you from
                              receiving comments that could trigger you.

                                <p>
                                  When you disable chat, make sure you disable
                                  the entire chat. When you disable the entire
                                  chat, you won\u2019t be able to type to your
                                  allies or the enemy, and you won\u2019t be
                                  able to see what your allies are saying. Yes,
                                  this is extreme, but it is crucial for those
                                  trying to stop being toxic in League of
                                  Legends. This will prevent you from typing bad
                                  things to your teammates when you feel
                                  they\u2019re messing up the entire game for
                                  you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

                                <p>
                                  This isn\u2019t something we would recommend,
                                  but if you\u2019re struggling and can\u2019t
                                  seem to get a grip on your toxicity, then this
                                  is an action you should take. If it\u2019s too
