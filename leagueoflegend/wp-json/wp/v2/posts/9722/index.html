  If you\u2019ve been playing League of Legends for a while, terms like
  \u201cCC\u201d and \u201ccrowd control score\u201d might be very familiar to
  you. But if you\u2019re a newer player and you just got flamed because you
  kept missing your CC all game without even knowing what it means &#8211;

    <p>
      Easy. As you guessed it, it\u2019s short for \u201ccrowd control.\u201d
      And <a
      href=\"https:\/\/egamesconsult.com\/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions\/\"
      data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"8923\">crowd control<\/a> is a category of
      abilities that either slow down or completely stop enemies. If we think
      about it a little, we can see that many different types of abilities in
      League of Legends are technically considered CC.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      The first example is, of course, slow effect. Malphite\u2019s Q &#8211;
      Seismic Shard or Kog\u2019Maw\u2019s E &#8211; Void Ooze both diminish the
      enemy\u2019s ability to move. Yes, they don\u2019t completely
      \u201cstop\u201d that enemy, but their slowing effect can be useful enough
      for either Malphite or Kog\u2019Maw to win the duel. And that\u2019s why
      the slowing effect is considered a CC in League of Legends. It reduces the
      enemy\u2019s ability to move, aka, it controls the crowd.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      So anything that can in any way impair a champion\u2019s ability to either
      move or casts spells is considered CC. The next famous example would
      obviously be the stun effect. Ashe\u2019s R &#8211; Enchanted Crystal
      Arrow literally stops the enemy from whatever he is doing. And the same
      goes for the rest of the stun abilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in League of Legends, there are multiple different types of CC, and
      it\u2019s sometimes impossible to distinguish them unless you know the
      spells by heart. One famous example here is Malzahar\u2019s R &#8211;
      Nether Grasp. His ultimate is actually a suppression and not a stun. So
      you can pick up a Cleanse and try to get out of it, but you won\u2019t be
      able to because
      <strong
        >Cleanse removes stun and slow effects, but not suppressions.<\/strong>
        This is crucial to understand if you want to become a better player in
        League of Legends.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
        <p>
          There is a similar case with airborne abilities. Yasuo\u2019s Q
          &#8211; Steel Tempest can take you in the air, and you won\u2019t be
          able to do anything against it. And buying a Quicksilver Sash is also
          pointless since it doesn\u2019t override the effect. What that means
          is that
          <strong
            >Quicksilver Sash will not disable airborne
            abilities.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n
            <p>
              Ahri\u2019s E &#8211; Charm or Seraphine\u2019s R &#8211; Encore
              can enchant the target to be both slowed and incapable of casting
              abilities and moving at the same time. This is called a charming
              effect and
              <strong
                >can easily be removed by using either Cleanse or
                QSS.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n
                <p>
                  And the same goes for the sleep effect, which can only be
                  found on two champions, really (not counting Sylas). <a

                  Sleepy Trouble Bubble and Lilia\u2019s R &#8211; Lilting
                  Lullaby are the only two abilities of this kind in LoL. First,
                  they put the target in a slow, called drowsy, then after a few
                  seconds in a stun, they sleep.

                        <p>
                          Applying the CC abilities in League of Legends
                          generates the crowd control score. The CCS is simply a
                          calculated number of how much time you\u2019ve kept
                          your enemies in stun, slow, root, etc. But crowd
                          control score is different for every champion and
                          every type of CC ability, so some champions can rack
                          it faster and some slower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Generally, a champion that can easily put another
                          champion in CC generates lower CSS numbers than a
                          skill shot-based one. For example, whenever Nocturne
                          activates his ultimate, the five opponents get blinded
                          by default. And because the person playing as Nocturne
                          didn\u2019t do anything special, that ability will add
                          smaller numbers to the score. But on the opposite
                          side, if Morgana keeps hitting her Qs all game long,
                          she will have an insane CSS at the end.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          So,
                          <strong
                            >every additional second of charm, suppression,
                            sleep, or any other CC enters the final
                            score.<\/strong> To get a better idea of what you
                            should be aiming for here is broad examples of good,
                            bad, and excellent crowd control

                                Anything from 500 to 700 is considered okay or
                                good.<\/li>

                                      Crowd control is an essential element to

                                      Legends. But because LoL is such a
                                      fast-paced game, even a second of CC might
                                      be too much for most champions and
                                      players. Many matches are decided by
                                      hitting one such ability on the right

                                      them and take the victory. We agree 100%

                                      Legends for a while, terms like
                                      \u201cCC\u201d and \u201ccrowd control
                                      score\u201d might be very familiar to you.
                                      But if you\u2019re a newer player and you
