                                              A person who plays games more

                                              Digital video games act as an
                                              escape for individuals who want to
                                              spend some time away from their
                                              hectic routines. Formerly, Steam
                                              was the only gaming service to

                                              gamers. Now many competitors have
                                              emerged in the online marketplace
                                              proving their worth by offering
                                              their customers better deals at
                                              affordable

                                              to buy video games, there is no
                                              better platform than an online
