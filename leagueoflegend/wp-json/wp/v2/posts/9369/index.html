Changing Your Name in League of Legends"},"content":{"rendered":"\n
<p>
  In League of Legends, any time you feel like doing so, you can change your
  name. However, you can only change your Summoner Name \u2013 as of right now,
  you cannot change your account name. So, when you pick your account name (if
  you haven\u2019t done so already), make sure you pick something that you
  don\u2019t mind sticking with for years to come.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

<h2>
  The Difference Between Account Name and Summoner Name<\/h2>\n\n\n\n
  <p>
    The difference between your account name and summoner name is that the
    summoner&#8217;s name is what everyone sees you as \u2013 this is what
    appears when you\u2019re in the game. The account name, on the other hand,
    is the name you use to login to the League of Legends
    client.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n

        If you really want to stand out from the crowd (most do), then a rare
        League of Legends name would be a good idea. Unfortunately, though, that
        \u201crare\u201d name is usually taken. We\u2019ve seen this scenario
        \u2013 a friend thought of an epic name, only to find that it was
        taken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
      </p>
      <p>
        Before you start bragging about that epic League of Legends name, it
        would be a good idea to check before-hand to make sure it isn\u2019t
        taken \u2013 in order to do this; you\u2019ll need to use a name checker
        to see if the name is available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
      </p>
      <p>
        There are times where Riot Games goes through and does a clean-up.
        During this time, they find the older names that have been inactive for
        quite some time and put them in the queue where they\u2019re available
        again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

            Checking for that available League of Legends name isn\u2019t all
            that hard. There are numerous ways to check if your desired name in
            LoL is available, but we recommend using the LoL client as it\u2019s
            the most reliable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n

              <p>
                In order to see if your chosen summoner name isn\u2019t taken,
                you can use the League of Legends client. All you have to do is
                open up your client and go to the store. From there, press the
                \u201cAccount\u201d button, which is located at the top right
                corner of the window.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you have done this, you will need to choose the
                \u2018Summoner Name Change\u201d option. Type in your desired
                Summoner Name and then click on the \u201cCheck Name\u201d
                button. You\u2019ll instantly find out if your chosen name is
                available to use. If it\u2019s not available, then keep checking
                for one until it says available.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n
