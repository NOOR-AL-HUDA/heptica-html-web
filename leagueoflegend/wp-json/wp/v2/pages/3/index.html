    <p>
      A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and
      numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by
      the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the
      browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either
      &#8220;persistent&#8221; cookies or &#8220;session&#8221; cookies: a
      persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid
      until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry
      date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the
      user session, when the web browser is closed. &nbsp;Cookies do not
      typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but
      personal information that we store about you may be linked to the
      information stored in and obtained from cookies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n
