										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The mid lane is arguably the most important Lane in League of Legends. Some may disagree, but many of our games will end up as a Mid push, a Mid group, or something else revolving around it. It is the central part of the game, and Champions that play it have the option of quickly roaming in all directions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lot of your Team fights will, too, be in the Mid Lane. Depending on when those fights occur, pivotal roles may shift and change. If they happen earlier on, the Mid Laner will likely be the one at the forefront. If he lacks team fight capacities, you will be severely disadvantaged and likely lose the fight altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early fights are not the only ones where a Mid Laner can strive as a Team fighter, but the pick must be right. We will go over the 5 Best Teamfighting Mid Laners in League of Legends in this list. Without a good Teamfighter, any team is bound for defeat, and it is a role that must be covered, if at least partially.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, without further ado, let’s see just who our 5 Best Teamfighting Mid Laners are.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Yasuo</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-yasuo-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13582" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-yasuo-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-yasuo-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-yasuo-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-yasuo-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-yasuo-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-yasuo-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-yasuo.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Yasuo is definitely one of the best Champions in League of Legends overall. As much as that pains me to say it, it simply is a matter of fact. I haven’t bought Yasuo still, and it’s well over half a decade since he was released. I just hate him that much. Apart from being one of the best Champions overall, he is also one of the best team fighters around.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I’ve pointed out in some other articles, I usually consider both Yone and Yasuo when choosing either of them for a detailed list. I also mutually exclude them due to how similar their kits and gameplay are. I know they’re not the same and have some very different mechanics. I just like to have one of them and not both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yasuo’s team fighting is incredible, and he only needs a Champion or two that can knock enemies up effectively. He can then use his Ultimate and quickly stack up a tornado for an extra knock-up, dealing huge damage. He hits fast and hard and can slice through enemies in the blink of an eye. He is, however, not tailored to be a team fighter per se, but he still excels in them and deserves a spot on every Team fighting list there is.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>4. Katarina</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-katarina-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13579" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-katarina-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-katarina-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-katarina-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-katarina-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-katarina-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-katarina-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-katarina.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Katarina is one of the best Assassins in League of Legends. And she is <em>the</em> best AP Assassin of them all, as I’ve indicated in our <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-ap-assassins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Best AP Assassins in League of Legends</a> </strong>list, so check that one out for more details. While lacking any form of CC or disable, Katarina has good AoE damage that can eviscerate health bars like paper. </p>



<p>A great deal of this damage lies in the daggers that bounce around and give her an AOE spin when she walks through them. A good Katarina player can have a lot of these daggers lying around during Team fights, giving them the chance of doing insane damage to multiple enemy targets. Her Q also bounces around between enemies, also dealing extra damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her Team fighting excellence comes to fruition with her incredible Ultimate spell. Katarina spins in place, dealing massive AOE damage in a wide radius. Apart from doing damage, she will also apply Grievous Wounds to enemies hit. This is not just your bog-standard 40% HP reduction, but the 60% one, equal to Ignite. This allows Katarina players to extremely limit the survivability and sustain of enemy Champions for at least a few seconds, which can be vital during high-intensity Team fights.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Diana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-diana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13577" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-diana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-diana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-diana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-diana-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-diana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-diana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-diana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Diana is a Champion that mostly strives during the Laning Phase and as an Assassin/Mage. But her Team fighting is nothing to skim over. Ever since her kit was shuffled around, she’s become a god at engaging multiple enemies and dealing heavy damage to them. She is one of the best Divers and Initiators League has ever seen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the Lane, she can poke you forever, constantly applying pressure and good damage. She does this to keep the distance between you and her so she can safely farm. Her melee attacks are detrimental to her overall gameplay as she must remain cautious about the distance between her and other players. This makes Diana an easy target for ganks early on. If she plays the Lane correctly, her Late game can only get better from that. One or two items are all it takes to turn Diana into an AP savage.</p>



<p>But, when talking about Team fights, Diana shines the brightest (quite literally) when using her Ultimate ability. This amazing spell is best used when you dash into multiple opponents (preferably the entire Team). You will pull them all in and follow up with a great smash that deals incredible damage. Pulling the enemies in is the most important part of the spell, as the CC can give your allies with AoE an easy opportunity to do devastating damage to the whole enemy team. </p>

<h2><strong>2.&nbsp; Lissandra</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-lissandra-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13580" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-lissandra-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-lissandra-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-lissandra-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-lissandra-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-lissandra-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-lissandra-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-lissandra.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>A rare pick nowadays (at least, I don’t see her often), Lissandra is one of those Champions that are purported for fighting multiple enemies. Whenever I meet her in the Lane, I approach the situation carefully. Lissandra can keep a distance and poke with her nice Q safely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rest of her kit, however, is built for team fighting. Lissandra can go in with her E and use her W to root enemies in an AoE around her. Her Ultimate serves much of the same purpose, though it will freeze only the Champion you cast it on, while the others in the area will be slowed. </p>



<p>The best course of action for her is to E into the enemy team, use your W to snare as many as possible, then Ult a vital target. If you lack Zhoyna’s, which you shouldn’t, you can also Ult yourself, healing up and creating the same area around you to slow enemies down. The slow is fairly substantial at level 16 (75%), which is an immobilizer great enough to substitute the lack of a proper stun on your Ultimate. Lissandra is a quick Champion that requires a high APM to perform correctly, so make sure you use that Practice Tool to iron out her combos and strats before giving into a ranked match.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Orianna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-orianna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13581" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-orianna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-orianna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-orianna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-orianna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-orianna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-orianna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-teamfight-mid-laners-orianna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Simplicity, fun, and ease make Orianna the best of the best when it comes to Mid Lane Team fighting. She has a basic, intriguing, and useful kit that can deal high damage, apply solid <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>, and even shield her. Orianna is one of my favorite Mid Lane picks in general, and I consider her definitely near the top of the best Mages in the game. Everyone can play her and likely play her well.</p>



<p>Orianna does take a bit to get used to, as she has the unique mechanic of using her Orb and moving it around. Everything about her kit revolves around the Orb, and the Orb actually uses the spells she uses. The only thing Orianna really does by herself are basic attacks. They are pretty strong for an AP Mage and can serve as a good poking tool if you want to save a bit of mana. Mana tends to be a problem for Orianna early on, but a quick purchase of Tear and stacking it up for Seraph’s Embrace will solve that issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her Team fighting, though, is what makes her the number one on this list. And most of her potential is in her Ultimate spell (shocker, I know). Orianna’s Orb has <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AoE damage</a> on all her spells if they land correctly. All deal a good amount of damage, and she is well known for one-shotting people with a QW combo. But her Ultimate is what makes Orianna a very dangerous pick to play against.</p>



<p>&nbsp;If you happen to cluster too close together, and you don’t have to be even that close, she can Ult all of you with the press of a button. A Flash Q-R combo is what I’d do to a tight group of opponents standing too close. Landing this combo correctly in the late game will more than likely kill at least 2 enemies instantly, leaving the others to be quickly swept up by your teammates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For people who hate to visit a traditional brick-and-mortar shop to buy video games, there is no better platform than an online website where you can easily download the best video games for your PC within the comfort of your home.</p>



<p>Although the market is often led by a single industry leader, many alternatives are considerably better. They offer an easy-to-download facility for their users and ensure that the process is thorough and easy to understand for all demographics.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll go through a list of the best online alternatives to satisfy your gaming needs and help you get good deals.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="500" height="333" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14867" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image.png 500w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-300x200.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-150x100.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Types of Video Games</strong></h2>



<p>Video games are categorized differently according to their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/importance-goals-design-gamification-games-karl-kapp/">objectives</a>, themes, and characteristics. There are numerous mechanisms through which developers structure their games. These games are further divided into their sub-genres. Each genre is designed to appeal to the taste of different users. The games are divided into the following genres:</p>



<ul><li>Action games,</li><li>Action-adventure games,</li><li>Adventure games,</li><li>Idle games,</li><li>Puzzle games</li><li>Role-playing games,</li><li>Simulation games,</li><li>Sports games,</li><li>Strategy games.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Alternative Ways to Download Video Games</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. GOG.com (Good Old Games) </strong></h3>



<p>GOG was previously known as Good Old Games. It is a subsidiary of CD Projekt managed by the developers of the popular Witcher series. You can find the best and improvised DRM-free standard computer games, indie games, and other famous computer games at the most affordable prices.</p>



<p>They also allow their users to link their other accounts. Furthermore, you can even compare games from other compatible stores like Epic Games Store, Steam, and even PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Uplay</strong></h3>



<p>Uplay is a digital store of the well-known video gaming company, Ubisoft. Unlike other platforms, Uplay provides a communication channel for its users to interact and chat with their friends online, making their gaming experience more fascinating.</p>



<p>It benefits its users with promotions and deals every Wednesday. After completing challenges you can even get hold of 20% Club discounts for your next purchases or you can subscribe to Uplay + for other benefits.</p>



<h3><strong>3. GMG-Green Man Gaming</strong></h3>



<p>GMG offers its customers the same design as its equivalents. Their website has expanded their catalog including the list of PC and Mac titles. The site offers users the best titles with standard sales prices. It’s important that you find yourself a site that is reliable and consistently provides updates and reviews, and the one that also allows you to <a href="https://install-game.com">download game pc free</a> of cost on their website. With a bit of research, you’ll be able to find the perfect site that has the games you love, whether it’s free of charge or at discounted rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What should matter for you is the security and quality of the download and gameplay. If you wish to take advantage of discounts, you can get hold of them by signing up for their loyalty program known as XP. Here you can earn rewards and XP after making purchases. Later you can even jump to different levels, namely, Gold, Bronze, Silver, where you can get the privilege of free purchases and discounts.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Itch.io</strong></h3>



<p>Itch.io is a great alternative to Steam that provides a plethora of indie titles and other games free of cost. It supersedes the mainstream gaming channels that like hogging the limelight by offering developers the ‘’pay what you want’’ model. Now developers can customize the theme of their page and set their price starting from $0 and upload their games.</p>



<h3><strong>6. Epic Games Store</strong></h3>



<p>Epic Games Store is the newest substitute for Steam in the online marketplace. Until now it has offered its audiences an array of free titles, exclusive deals, and affordable games. The creator of Fortnite also allows an 88% revenue-sharing scheme for developers. However, you might incur some browsing errors and privacy issues.</p>



<h2><strong>The Benefits of Video Games</strong></h2>



<p>Video games often carry the negative connotation of laziness. A person who plays games more often needs to be more than a couch potato. Although most people consider gaming to only consist of bad outcomes, you might not know that playing a video game helps sharpen a person’s mind by teaching them new skills and ways to escape puzzling situations.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="500" height="334" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14868" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-1.png 500w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-1-300x200.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-1-150x100.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>



<p>Besides entertaining users, games are a great source for learning, strategic thinking, and <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-ways-to-dramatically-improve-your-creativity.html">creativity</a>. It empowers a person to have effective communications and explore and expand their mental capacities by letting them solve problems productively. The ability to assess and identify possible risks and rewards helps gamers to utilize these strengths in their careers.</p>



<p>Digital video games act as an escape for individuals who want to spend some time away from their hectic routines. Formerly, Steam was the only gaming service to provide the gamic experience and attend to the needs of avid gamers. Now many competitors have emerged in the online marketplace proving their worth by offering their customers better deals at affordable prices.</p>

<p>Assassins in League of Legends are those Champions that make you crap your pants. If you’re an ADC, squishy support, or any other low defense role/class, Assassins can ruin your life. Whenever you see them approaching, or even in the distance, you know they’re coming for you.</p>



<p>League’s grim reapers come in many different shapes and sizes. We’ve covered the <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-assassins-in-league-of-legends" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Best Assassins in League of Legends</a></strong>, where we went over the generally best picks. In that list, there was a strong presence of AD Champions, including the number one spot. </p>



<p>But, as is the case with many League of Legends classes, AP Champions are there too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this list, we’ll go over the best AP Assassins in the game currently. Their playstyles usually don’t differ too much, but if left unhinged, their damage certainly can be a sight to behold. Though not really if you’re on the receiving end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let us begin with our list.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>7. Akali</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13585" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Akali is a solid Champion to play as, though perhaps not so intuitive. Her kit is fairly straightforward, and you have the mobility to do the classic in-and-out tactic without breaking a sweat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her damage, like the rest on the list, is remarkable. She will often take the Conqueror rune, allowing her to heal for days and make your life miserable. You will often meet her on the Top Lane, and while she does excel against most classes, she can struggle against bruisers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Picking a good tank that can outlast her in fights and trade blows with her is paramount to winning. Keep in mind that Akali does tend to pull out a few tricks from her sleeve and deal damage/heal unexpectedly. She can Lane and will scale strongly into the late game, so beware of her when she picks up an item or two.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>6. Ekko</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13587" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>I include Ekko so low on this list because of how boring he is to play with/against. Of course, this is my opinion, so I’m sorry to any Ekko mains out there that might be reading this list. But I digress.</p>



<p>Ekko is a strong mage Assassin that can be pretty difficult to Lane against. He has a nice, though a bit difficult to land, poke, and can close gaps easily with his E. His W is a skill-shot shield <em>and</em> can be a stun if he catches you in the area. The stun seemingly lasts forever, so be advised and stay away from it when you see it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His R is a nightmare to deal with. He can rewind time and heal back to full if he lands it right. This more or less means you have to kill him twice or that he’ll escape most of the fights he’s in. Apart from that, it also deals a ton of damage in the area he goes back to. Ekko is one of those Champions that <em>really </em>make you have to build up your defenses. Tenacity and MR are core to countering his otherwise strong <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> and Damage.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Evelynn</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13588" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>She somehow seems to find her way into most of these champion lists. This just proves how versatile, and fun this Champion is (or just how biased I am towards her, whichever suits you best). League’s seductor epitomizes the Assassin role, utilizing invisibility and shadows to achieve her goals. </p>



<p>As I said, Evelynn prowls the darkness of the Rift and strives within it. Until level 6, she will be completely visible to everyone at all times. Level 6 comes by fast, so prepare to be ganked into oblivion. Evelynn is what I like to call – an executor. This means her entire purpose is to finish you off without using too many spells. Yes, she has her W purported for ganks and utility, but her E and R are well enough to do the job most of the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Q is there too when the enemy is running away and providing an easy proc of your W whenever the need arises. The W also amplifies the damage from the abilities that proc it, making it a great tool to amplify your damage in various situations.<strong> </strong>Be sure to buy those Control Wards if you wish to survive this invisible menace.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>4. Diana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13586" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Ever since her kit was shuffled around a bit, Diana has become very fun to play. Though I rarely, if ever, play her, I like seeing her on my team. The opposite is true when she’s part of the enemy roster, and I dread the very moment I started the queue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Diana can be very difficult to play against, and that’s an understatement. If you’re a melee Champion, especially one that has a poor early game, expect to be tossed around the Lane like you were nothing but a toy. She can keep her distance and deal constant, low cooldown damage with her Q. It’s a great poke and is not easy to dodge once you’re in range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She can subsequently close the said gap using her E, do severe damage, shield herself with her W, and pull you in and blast you with her Ultimate. Her ability to engage in large groups of enemies and use her amazing kit to CC all of them makes her one of the best team fighters in the game. This is the exact reason why you should consider focusing her down before big fights in the late game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Fizz</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13589" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This maritime devil makes me hate myself. I usually play Gangplank or Twisted Fate mid, and people just always pick this stupid Champion. It’s infuriating and an instant loss of the Lane, at least early on. That is where Fizz shines. He prevents you from enjoying/functioning during the laning phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He can poke, dodge, go in, go out. Everything you can think of, Fizz can do. I know very few ways of fighting against him, so I advise you to pick him rather than opting to go against him. If, by chance, you do meet him, tell your jungler to camp the Lane. Slowing down or stopping Fizz’s rather quick <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-snowballing-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="10383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowball</a> will help you and your time have a greater chance of containing and defeating him. </p>



<p>Watch out for his roams, though, as he can come back as fast as you put him down. A few kills are all it takes to make or break games, so don’t be reluctant to beat him while he’s down.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>2. Kassadin</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13590" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Kassadin is secretly one of the most broken champions in League of Legends. He broke the game more times than I could count, and he keeps doing it to this very day. Whenever I play him, I see enemy players going wild in all chat with various messages, pleasant and unpleasant alike. </p>



<p>They have a good reason for this, as Kassadin is one of the most severe cases of snowballing in the history of League of Legends. He doesn’t exactly have the best laning phase or early game. His strength lies in the post 20 minute period, where he likely will have a stacked-up Seraph’s Embrace or at least one mythic item like Luden’s Tempest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are his power spikes, and with each item, he just keeps growing. The reduction of his Ultimate’s mana cost from 800 to 640 at max stacks will also help you stay in the fight for a while longer. Mana is your biggest handicap, so going for items with the highest mana efficiency is key to keeping yourself dormant and dominant. I also suggest taking Fleet Footwork to give yourself some healing later on, which you will certainly lack.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Katarina</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13591" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This Champion fails to be anything but the best in her class. She’s simple, easy to pick up and play, and doesn’t have too much about her that’s necessarily complex. Sure, learning some of those wild combos and dashes that would give anyone motion sickness is not easy, but it isn’t exactly rocket science either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Katarina has a good laning phase that can win against most opponents. However, some on this list can likely beat her in Lane but can never snowball as fast and easy as she does. Snowballing is a reoccurring theme with assassins. Their items are not too expensive, and getting kills is super easy considering their kits were tailored around it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Katarina is the queen of roams, and she will roam to every part of the map you can think of. Most Katarina players focus on the bottom Lane, especially if it is losing. Strengthening the position of your other lanes while keeping the mid Lane secure and stable will help you limit and stop Katarina’s snowball. Being this map-aware and present is excruciatingly difficult for a jungle player, especially a lower elo one, so give it your best to limit her as much as possible or accept a defeat and move on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Whether they be AP or AD, Assassins are Riot’s favorite class. If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be meta picks for God knows how long now. Hopefully, they die down a little bit, and actually, good roles will come into fruition, but until then, we can only join them and play the best of the best.</p>



<p>Let us know what your favorite Assassins in League of Legends are. Are they AP? Would you include them on this list, and why? We always love to hear from you, so don’t miss out on letting us know what you think.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Twitch&#8217;s comeback in the bot lane was surprisingly popular in season 11. Despite his high win rate in the jungle, Twitch is an obnoxious carry from downtown too. His damage has never been higher than now and that&#8217;s all thanks to the item changes Riot brought us this year. So to say the least &#8211; Twitch is a solid ADC pick right now. And if you&#8217;re looking to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-quickly-climb-the-league-of-legends-rank-ladder/" data-type="post" data-id="8671" target="_blank">climb the solo queue ladder </a>with your Twitch partner, here are the top 7 best supports for you in season 11.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that we chose these champions based on performance, win rate, and overall synergy. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t pair Twitch with other picks, but you&#8217;ll lose on some obvious benefits. Twitch is a type of marksman that doesn&#8217;t go particularly well with wombo-combo team compositions, since he doesn&#8217;t have a one-shot playstyle. Instead, he grows much stronger when multiple champions are there to protect him, so make sure you draft accordingly.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the 7 best supports for Twitch in season 11 and why you should play them!</p>

<h1><strong>7 Best Supports For Twitch</strong></h1>



<h2><strong>1. Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-lulu-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12616" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-lulu-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-lulu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-lulu-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-lulu-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-lulu-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-lulu-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-lulu.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Twitch and Lulu have always had a place in the bot lane meta thanks to their incredible synergy. Both champions are dependent on each other, but that&#8217;s exactly what makes them strong too. You can often see experienced duo partners smurfing on these two picks even in high elo.</p>



<p>For starters, the Lulu + Twitch lane should almost always be passive. Thanks to Lulu&#8217;s shields, Twitch can stay in the backline, safely farm, and prepare for the mid-game. Lulu can also poke opponents and chase them off before they even attack.</p>



<p>One of the most popular tricks that this combo can do is for Twitch to hide in invisibility and Lulu to walk alone into the enemy territory. This is often a good bait since Twitch can surprise the opponent and secure the kill. Spotting a squishy Lulu is usually an easy target for junglers or mid laners, but that&#8217;s exactly where Twitch can intervene and change the odds.</p>



<p>Once a team fight breaks, Lulu can amplify Twitch&#8217;s damage with her passive. The fae Pix does a considerable amount of damage, especially when Twitch is using his ultimate. Lulu&#8217;s R can be used defensively when the enemies retaliate, so Twitch can feel pretty safe in all possible scenarios.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12615" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Janna has a very similar style to Lulu, with a couple of differences here and there.</p>



<p>First off, Janna&#8217;s damage output is a bit lower than Lulu&#8217;s, so you should always think twice about starting a fight before your Twitch is fed. Obviously, Janna can do a fantastic job of protecting Twitch in the bot lane, but she shouldn&#8217;t rush to engage in skirmishes that shouldn&#8217;t happen at all.</p>



<p>Once the mid-game kicks in, this duo can unleash mayhem on Summoner&#8217;s Rift. Twitch&#8217;s invisibility is a real advantage that can create many opportunities. As mentioned above, Janna can roam freely to lure in enemies so Twitch can come out and spray them all to death.</p>



<p>Janna&#8217;s R is another tool that you have for saving Twitch from trouble. You can either use it to heal Twitch during a fight or push enemies away as they&#8217;re trying to reach him.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Yuumi</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-yummi-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12617" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-yummi-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-yummi-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-yummi-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-yummi-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-yummi-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-yummi-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-yummi-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-twitch-yummi.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Twitch and Yuumi is probably the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-troll-bot-lane-combos/" data-type="post" data-id="11845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most fun combo</a> that you can play in League of Legends. These two characters are a total blast and can int anyone on the opposing team.</p>



<p>The key synergy here is the fact that Twitch&#8217;s camouflage also puts Yuumi in invisibility if she&#8217;s attached to him. You can use this ability to become invisible as you&#8217;re coming to the lane and surprise your bot lane opponents. After level 6, when Yuumi unlocks her root, this combo is even deadlier since Twitch can freely attack the crowd-controlled targets.</p>



<p>During the laning phase, the cat and the rat should be particularly careful since Twitch doesn&#8217;t have any way of avoiding CC. He&#8217;ll always be the primary target of the enemy team, so it&#8217;s up to the Twitch player to be tactical. However, the Yuumi player can help by walking up to the enemy for auto-attacks and being overall offensive. She always has her W safe card, so she shouldn&#8217;t be afraid at all!</p>



<h2><strong>4. Braum</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-braum-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14895" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-braum-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-braum-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-braum-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-braum-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-braum-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-braum-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-braum.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Twitch has plenty of ways to proc Braum&#8217;s passive stun. He can position to the opponent&#8217;s side with the stealth from his Q, he can W to have an AOE slow on the enemy as well, and when Twitch reaches 6 and has the extended range from his ultimate, it becomes child&#8217;s play. You may try to guess what happens to a champion that is stunned in front of an ulting Twitch.</p>



<p>As an added bonus, Braum has excellent peel and tankiness with his W, E, and R abilities to keep Twitch safe since the Plague Rat lacks any sort of viable escape tools to get away from danger.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Soraka</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-soraka-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14897" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-soraka-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-soraka-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-soraka-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-soraka-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-soraka-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-soraka-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-soraka.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Twitch is good at trading, thanks to his passive and his E ability. He needs some time to stack it and cast his E on a fully stacked target, which opens him up to the enemy trading back. Soraka can help mitigate the health Twitch trades back thanks to her unparalleled sustain.</p>



<p>Thanks to her Q, she can sustain herself as well (provided she lands it, of course), and her E silence is excellent at stopping champions that need to cast their abilities to be impactful in fights, which are pretty much all champions except some ADCs.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-nami-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14896" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-nami-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-nami-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-nami-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-nami-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-nami-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-nami-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-nami.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Remember Twitch needed time to stack his passive? Nami makes this easy thanks to her E. This empowers Twitch&#8217;s basic attacks and applies a slow to the target, enabling him to catch up if they attempt to flee.</p>



<p>Nami&#8217;s Q is an excellent tool for both offense and defense, as it can catch and lock down an opponent for Twitch to stack his E, and she may also chain it with her ult when it is available.</p>



<h2><strong>7. Blitzcrank</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14894" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-blitzcrank-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-blitzcrank-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-blitzcrank-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-blitzcrank-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-blitzcrank-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-twitch-supports-blitzcrank.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Twitch and Blitz have a pretty nasty combo they can perform if the situation presents itself. Whenever Blitz does his trademark Q E combo, Twitch can Q for the attack speed steroid and W on the opponent to have them slowed for the duration, allowing him to stack for a sweet chunk of damage.</p>



<p>During teamfights, the disruption that Blitz can cause is fantastic for Twitch to be able to ult and hit multiple targets, giving his team an advantage. If Blitz stays nearby, he should fend off attackers with his Q and E to protect Twitch.</p>

<p>Ezreal is perhaps the most unique ADC champion in League of Legends. He is technically considered a mage and not a marksman, so choosing a support for him isn&#8217;t always easy. Ezreal plays the bot lane in a very specific way, and there are certain champions that fit his playstyle. And in this guide, we&#8217;ll talk about the top 7 best supports for Ezreal in season 11 and how they can set him up for carrying.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that in the chaos of solo queue, you can pair Ezreal with any other champion. However, you should always think about how the other champions in your team can benefit him in-game, especially if you&#8217;re the support. So let&#8217;s take a look at the 7 champions you should consider playing in combo with Ezreal!</p>

<h1><strong>7 Best Supports for Ezreal</strong></h1>



<h2><strong>1. Lux</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ez-lux-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12063" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ez-lux-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ez-lux-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ez-lux-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ez-lux-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ez-lux-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ez-lux.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Lux and Ezreal pair might be a meme, but the truth is that they&#8217;re one of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most powerful bot lane combos in LoL</a>. They have an insane amount of burst damage, something that not too many champions can survive early on.</p>



<p>The way you play Lux and Ezreal in the laning phase is simply by poking. Once the enemies are near 50% HP, Lux can look to land a Q. Rooting one opponent usually means a kill, since both Lux and Ezreal can quickly land their skill shots one after the other.</p>



<p>But the biggest power spike of this combo is level 6. Both Ezreal&#8217;s and Lux&#8217;s ultimates are long-range abilities that damage all enemies in the area. This allows them to play hyper-aggressively and constantly look for kills around the map. And the best part is that they don&#8217;t necessarily need to be in the midst of the fight to secure those kills &#8211; they can simply cast spells from afar!</p>



<p>Laning against Lux and Ezreal is truly painful. If they&#8217;re experienced, their enemies will often look to recall since Lux and Ezreal can poke endlessly. So don&#8217;t hesitate to give them a shot!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Seraphine</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supports-for-ezreal-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12062" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supports-for-ezreal-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supports-for-ezreal-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supports-for-ezreal-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supports-for-ezreal-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supports-for-ezreal-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supports-for-ezreal.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Seraphine can be a substitute for Lux in case you want something less aggressive and more reliable. The reason why Seraphine may have an advantage in supporting Ezreal is that she brings healing on top of damage and CC while Lux only the latter.</p>



<p>Ezreal and Seraphine can either play the laning phase aggressively or defensively. Seraphine is extremely good at all aspects of being a support, so it&#8217;s not difficult for her to match the flow of Ezreal. When playing defensively, she can hover behind Ezreal shield/heal him. And when playing aggressively, she can constantly look to poke and slow/root enemies.</p>



<p>As with Lux, Ezreal and Seraphine become much more powerful on level 6. Seraphine&#8217;s charm is one of the strongest crowd control abilities in the game because it travels through units in a very long range. And this is perfect for setting up Ezreal&#8217;s damage, especially his own ultimate. A Seraphine + Ezreal R combo usually means free kills for them.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ezreal-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12064" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ezreal-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ezreal-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ezreal-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ezreal-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ezreal-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/best-supps-for-ezreal.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Nami may not be the most popular support champion in League of Legends, but she is the best among the supports for Ezreal in season 11. And one look at her abilities is enough to convince you why that is true.</p>



<p>First up, Nami provides a knock-up effect through her Q on a short cooldown. In most situations, this gives Ezreal enough time to set up his W+Q combo. But Nami can also buff Ezreal&#8217;s spells with her E, which is a huge benefit to any ADC, especially Ezreal since he relies on his abilities more than others.</p>



<p>Nami&#8217;s W is another fantastic ability in LoL. Not only does it heal an ally, but it also jumps to an enemy champion to damage them for the same amount. Experienced Nami players would often try to double the value of the spell by casting it when both the ally and the enemy are close to each other. This will make the healing tide bounce between them which should be your goal as well.</p>



<p>And lastly, Nami&#8217;s ultimate is another way of setting up Ezreal&#8217;s damage. Her R slows all targets after the initial knock-up, which allows Ezreal to land all of his skill shots.</p>

<h2><strong>4. Soraka</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-soraka-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14902" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-soraka-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-soraka-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-soraka-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-soraka-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-soraka-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-soraka-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-soraka.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>No hate to you Ezreal mains out there, but Ezreal is pretty useless early in the game. He does have great poke but lacks any real kill pressure in the early stages of a match. Soraka is a well-known sustain support that can keep Ezreal in lane for longer to get him to farm and scale.</p>



<p>Once Ezreal buys his first couple of items, he can freely attempt to trade a bit more aggressively, and Soraka can keep him healthy while he does so. This is an exceptionally safe lane, which may frustrate the opposition, causing them to make mistakes you can take advantage of to gain a further lead.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14901" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Janna is another champion that can keep Ez safe while he farms. Ezreal by himself is a very slippery and hard to kill ADC, thanks to his E and the fact that he can build tanky items like Frozen Heart and still dish out a lot of damage. With Janna&#8217;s whirlwinds, shields, and a disengage tool as vital as her ultimate, Ezreal will be near unkillable.</p>



<p>She can also use her abilities to poke and just be obnoxious all around, and laning against a duo that can poke you like these two is rage-inducing.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Alistar</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-alistar-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14900" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-alistar-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-alistar-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-alistar-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-alistar-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-alistar-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-alistar-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-alistar.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Minotaur gives Ezreal a tanky frontline that can endure some hits on his behalf while still remaining healthy. Alistar is a good disruptor with his W Q combo, and most players will get scared off and just back off in fear of allowing him to charge and use the stun from his E. Should the entire combo land, Ezreal had a lot of time to poke at the enemy.</p>



<p>Apart from being really beefy, Alistar offers some sustain as well, thanks to his passive. Since he makes it challenging for the opposition to get near Ezreal anyway, any bit of damage that does get through can just be healed back up by farming.</p>



<h2><strong>7. Taric</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-taric-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14903" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-taric-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-taric-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-taric-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-taric-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-taric-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-taric-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-ezreal-supports-taric.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>You may believe this is just for the meme, but Ezreal and Taric do very well together in the bottom lane. Ezreal&#8217;s E is almost as fast to cast as flash, meaning if timed right, Ezreal may E into an opponent as Taric&#8217;s E is finishing its channel, giving the enemy a minuscule amount of time to react, basically guaranteeing a stun.</p>



<p>As a plus, Taric brings a lot of durability to the lane, offering Ezreal bonus defensive stats to endure more damage, as well as packing heals and an ultimate that can single-handedly win teamfights thanks to the invulnerability it gives to his allies.</p>



<p>Those are the 7 best supports for Ezreal in season 11 of League of Legends!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Caitlyn has been an incredibly popular pick in season 11. Since the start of the year, she&#8217;s been rocking the bot lane with the new mythic item Galeforce. And from a traditional marksman, Caitlyn became the ultra-powerful <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-hyper-carries/" data-type="post" data-id="9744" target="_blank">hyper-carry that dominates League of Legends</a>. Her current win rate isn&#8217;t as impressive as the one at the start of the season, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that Caitlyn isn&#8217;t a strong pick now too! Today we&#8217;ll talk about the 7 supports that synergize best with Caitlyn and how you can make this champion work in season 11!</p>



<p>Keep in mind that you don&#8217;t our 7 choices aren&#8217;t the only viable option for Cait on Summoner&#8217;s Rift. Truthfully, you can pair her with any champion that offers some form of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank">CC</a> or an engage tool. Caitlyn&#8217;s damage potential is incredibly high, but she cannot keep targets in place once her trap is down. Her long-range can&#8217;t keep up with many movement speed effects this season, so it&#8217;s best to have a support with a good mix of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8923" target="_blank">crowd control abilities</a>.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the top 7 best supports for Caitlyn in LoL season 11!</p>



<h1><strong>7 Best Supports for Caitlyn</strong></h1>



<h2><strong>1. Morgana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-caitlyn-morgana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12297" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-caitlyn-morgana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-caitlyn-morgana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-caitlyn-morgana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-caitlyn-morgana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-caitlyn-morgana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supports-for-caitlyn-morgana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Caitlyn and Morgana are probably the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most powerful combo you can run in the bot lane</a>. Both of these champions are incredible on their own, but together they make one of the toughest matchups to beat.</p>



<p>Morgana&#8217;s Q is an obnoxious ability that roots the target for several seconds. This gives Caitlyn enough time to put down a trap and secure a headshot auto-attack against them. Each time Morgana has her Dark Binding available, the duo can look to punish their opponents. Obviously, Caitlyn can also follow up on the damage with both her Q and E. The 90 Caliber Net also provides a free headshot, so it&#8217;s best to use it while an enemy is in root.</p>



<p>Once level 6 arrives, this combo becomes even more powerful. Morgana&#8217;s ultimate is a fantastic <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AoE</a> stun that Caitlyn can use to damage multiple enemies. And although her ultimate only hits one target, it&#8217;s a good finisher move that guarantees an okay amount of damage.</p>



<p>Morgana also brings her Black Shield, so you have no reason to not try her as a support to Caitlyn in season 11!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-thresh-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12295" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-thresh-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-thresh-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-thresh-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-thresh-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-thresh-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-thresh.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Players often say that Thresh is the perfect support for every ADC in League of Legends. And while we aren&#8217;t completely sure, we can safely say that the statement is true for Caitlyn!</p>



<p>Thresh comes with a big range of crowd control abilities. All of his abilities, except the W, apply some sort of disability to the target. And whether it&#8217;s stun, slow, or knock-up effect, Cait can use these to secure traps and nets to trigger headshots. Headshots are the key element of dealing damage as Caitlyn and Thresh can help you a lot with that.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Thresh is the only support champion that brings a mobility option for Caitlyn besides movement speed. His lantern can be a long-range engaging and disengaging tool for Cait, depending on the situation. Thresh can quickly get her out of a sticky situation, but also bring her into a beneficial situation too. All in all, this is a very fun combo that you must try!</p>

<h2><strong>3. Blitzcrank</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-blitzkrank-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12294" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-blitzkrank-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-blitzkrank-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-blitzkrank-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-blitzkrank-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-blitzkrank-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-supp-for-caitlyn-blitzkrank.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Blitzcrank doesn&#8217;t have the most positive reputation among the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/why-is-league-of-legends-community-so-toxic/" data-type="post" data-id="9044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">League of Legends community</a>. His performance usually depends on the player&#8217;s ability to hit the most dangerous skill shot in the game &#8211; Rocket Grab. But if you can manage that, Blitz and Caitlyn are one of the deadliest combos you can play!</p>



<p>Unlike in the previous seasons, Blitzcrank&#8217;s damage in season 11 is significantly high. His ultimate is an amazing ability to have since it grants an AoE silence to all champions around Blitz. It&#8217;s on a considerably low cooldown, so Blitz can use it in every fight after level 6.</p>



<p>But the biggest synergy between these champions comes as early as level 2. Blitz can grab an enemy, bring them to his position (near Caitlyn) and instantly knock them up. This is the perfect opportunity for Caitlyn to put down her trap and fire a headshot. It&#8217;s by far the easiest trap setup that you can do in League, so we highly recommend it!</p>



<h2><strong>4. Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lulu-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14907" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lulu-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lulu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lulu-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lulu-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lulu-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lulu-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lulu.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Caitlyn uses Lulu&#8217;s kit well, thanks to her superior range, making her one of the best ADCs to go with the Fae Sorceress. Caitlyn, buffed with Lulu&#8217;s W and E, can become very annoying, very fast. Thanks to Lulu&#8217;s Pix, the amount of poke and its range is tough to deal with, granting her attack speed, movement speed, and bonus damage on each attack.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, I&#8217;ll just jump on her and immediately one-shot her!&#8221; you may think. Word of advice from a player that mostly plays assassins and has been through more polymorphs than I would like: You won&#8217;t kill her, so don&#8217;t try it. Lulu&#8217;s polymorph on its own is usually enough to keep Cait alive. Should that fail, Wild Growth definitely won&#8217;t. Enlarging the ally it was cast on and giving bonus health, going through all that will certainly be no easy feat.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Senna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-senna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14909" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-senna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-senna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-senna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-senna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-senna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-senna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-senna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>What do you get when you pair up the ADC with the highest base range and the support that can gain more attack range as the game goes on? Absolute madness. These two have incredible poke thanks to their respective Q abilities, and if you think they&#8217;re easy to catch, think again, as a Caitlyn trap is a free root for Senna, and vice-versa, really.</p>



<p>They don&#8217;t even need to push that far up the lane to deal damage, given their range. If Senna is constantly harassing the enemy to gain her passive stacks, she will eventually become impossible to deal with even on her own.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Lux</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lux-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14908" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lux-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lux-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lux-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lux-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lux-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lux-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-lux.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Lux and Cait have a really bursty composition. If Lux lands a Light Binding, Cait can quickly follow up with a trap, similar to her synergy with Morgana. Contrary to Morgana, however, Lux is much more burst-oriented rather than dealing damage over time. A Lux Q can set up her E R, as well as Caitlyn&#8217;s Q W, and, in the unlikely chance your target is still standing after that, Caitlyn still has her ultimate too.</p>



<p>In lane, Lux is absurdly uncomfortable to deal with. Flinging out roots and poke that covers a wide area, there&#8217;s really no stopping her unless she runs out of mana, which will pretty much never happen once she buys Lost Chapter and stacks a Tear of the Goddess. Her W shield is really overlooked when trading; since it can basically give two shield iterations in a single cast, it has a high potential to decide who won or lost the trade.</p>



<h2><strong>7. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14906" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/best-caitlyn-supports-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Caitlyn enjoys playing with a hard engager such as Leona because she can watch the show from afar and deal her damage without coming in too close. Leona is exceptionally tanky, especially when she has her W up, meaning she has no problem taking the short end of the stick in a trade.</p>



<p>Boasting a rock-solid engage with her E Q combo, Leona can lock down a target in place long enough for Caitlyn to set up her trap, as well as land her Q and a couple of autos for free. Once she reaches level 6, her R further increases the duration of the chain.</p>



<p>Those are the top 7 best supports for Caitlyn in League of Legends season 11!</p>

<p>Teamfight Tactics is Riot Games’ auto battler game, also known as TFT. Similar to DOTA 2’s Auto Chess, Teamfight Tactics pits you against seven other players as you recruit powerful champions and deploy them to the field for battle. TFT matches are usually shorter than a Summoner’s Rift match, so the surrender timer is also different for the game.</p>



<h2><strong>When Can You Surrender?</strong></h2>



<p>You can surrender in a TFT match after the 10-minute mark. The 10-minute mark should be around the 9th battle, where you are supposed to battle three krugs, also called Round 2-7, the last battle of Round 2. Before you get to this point, you will have to go through Rounds 1 and 2, including 3 PvE battles (excluding the krugs), 5 PvP battles, and two carousel rounds.</p>



<p><strong><em>Once you reach the 10-minute mark, you can surrender at any time.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong>How to Surrender in TFT</strong></h2>

<p>Surrendering in TFT is similar to surrendering in a League of Legends match. There are two main ways to go about it:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Pressing the Surrender button in the menu after pressing Escape</strong></li><li><strong>Typing “/ff” in the chatbox, as well as other variations like /surrender, /concede, or /forfeit</strong></li></ul>



<p>Note that unlike surrendering in League of Legends, surrendering in TFT does not require a prompt from the other players. Since TFT is a single-player game, you are simply leaving the current TFT game, and the game you surrendered on will continue for those who are still playing.</p>



<p>With that said, you also cannot start a new match right after you surrender. The client still counts you as “in-game” despite having left, so you will have to wait for a while before being able to start a new match.</p>



<h2><strong>Penalty for Surrendering in TFT</strong></h2>



<p>As a single-player auto battler game, there is no penalty for surrendering in a TFT match. Compared to League of Legends, surrendering in TFT is laxer than a game of League of Legends, where you have to put up with four other people and wait for them to accept defeat and surrender.</p>



<p>With that said, by surrendering, the game immediately places you in the last place among the remaining living players. If you surrender in a ranked TFT game while more than half of the players are left, you would be immediately ranked among the bottom four, counting as a loss and making you lose LP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karthus, the Deathsinger, may be undead, but he still knows how to be stylish with his skins. Karthus is a character with a unique personality that allows room for many different types of skins. Let this skin review help your decision on what to bring to battle when you play Karthus.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Phantom Karthus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="512" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13562" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-1024x512.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-300x150.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-768x384.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-1536x768.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-150x75.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-360x180.jpg 360w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-750x375.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-1140x570.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Phantom Karthus displays Karthus as a lich or a battle mage. His outfit consists of him covered in armor, and he wears a tattered black robe that helps the lich theme. While the skin doesn&#8217;t present itself with much originality, it&#8217;s rather appealing for its visuals and its low price. This skin will be loved by fans of Karthus that are looking for a simple look at a low price.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Changes</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 460 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>2.&nbsp; Statue of Karthus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13563" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>While the skin has a unique concept, the Statue of Karthus does fail to appeal. The theme is unique in that it gives a lich a Statue of Liberty look, which can be seen as a little whimsical. Considering it’s an American symbol, it&#8217;s bound to not appeal to everyone worldwide. The look is an interesting take on Karthus; it can be adored by fans in America or that simply love the look.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Changes</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>3. Grim Reaper Karthus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="512" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13559" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-1024x512.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-300x150.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-768x384.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-1536x768.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-150x75.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-360x180.jpg 360w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-750x375.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-1140x570.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>We can&#8217;t have a lich without presenting himself as the grim reaper. It&#8217;s a fitting skin for his personality and characteristics; the execution is nicely done with realizing the theme of the Angel of Death. The model accomplishes the concept’s appearance, which is nothing more unique than what you normally see with a Grim Reaper. Grim Reaper Karthus doesn&#8217;t go above and beyond, and that&#8217;s okay, as the skin already is appealing. Lovers of the look and Karthus will find this skin perfect for them.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Changes</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</p>

<h2><strong>4. Pentakill Karthus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13561" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Pentakill Karthus displays him as a heavy metal singer, which is another skin that suits his personality. His outfit is attractive and elegant; he wields a staff that is now a microphone. Pentakill Is a skin that is always entertaining and a nice tribute to heavy metal fans that many will appreciate. While the skin isn&#8217;t too unique of a concept, it&#8217;s still charming.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Changes</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 750 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>5. Fnatic Karthus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13558" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Fnatic Karthus gives him a colorful look like a warlock in what seems to be a modern look. The skin is elaborate and somewhat unique. The modern aspect feels a bit lacking, and the skin is all about your preference. Fnatic Karthus is a decent option if you enjoy a new modern look for him; other than that, it doesn&#8217;t present itself with many features.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Major Model Changes</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 750 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>6. Karthus Lightsbane</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="602" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-1024x602.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13560" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-1024x602.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-300x176.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-768x451.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-1536x903.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-150x88.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-750x441.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-1140x670.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Karthus Lightsbane gives him another warlock look; it’s a different interpretation for Karthus. Rather than looking dead, he looks alive, giving away his lich persona. The white hair contrasts nicely with the clothes, with a gothic look for any outfit. Robes are decorated, shoulders add a nice touch, and the staff gets a new look. Everything is rather different than the classic Karthus. Particles represent runic patterns, and the sounds give an eerie, haunting sound. The sounds match the theme quite nicely. Karthus Lightsbane isn&#8217;t that extraordinary, but the idea is different and unique. His fans will find the skin to be appealing for battle.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New Model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animation</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The skin is unique, so there isn&#8217;t much of a con to it</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The highly recommended skin is Grim Reaper Karthus; the idea matches his persona. It embraces him in a dark look as the Angel of Death. Phantom Karthus represents him as an undead battle mage. The skin is appealing and inexpensive, making it a good choice.</p>



<p>The Statue of Karthus is a skin presenting itself as a less serious look for Karthus. The look isn&#8217;t for everyone as it&#8217;s the Statue of Liberty, an American symbol, but the look still is somewhat appealing. Pentakill Karthus is a nice skin for those that enjoy the genre. It’s appealing and suiting for Karthus, as it matches his personality. Many will come to enjoy this skin.</p>



<p>Karthus Lightsbane is a skin that is straight to the point, with nothing too special. The visuals are appealing and are packed full of features, but it’s nothing out of this world. Fnatic Karthus is a modern Karthus that is lacking in anything special. The skin will be overlooked unless you&#8217;re someone that happens to enjoy the look.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>League of Legends has no shortage of unique characters and exciting-to-play picks. And while there are<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-many-champions-are-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> over 150 champions </a>in the game right now, not all of them are on the same pedestal. Some champions are widely beloved and enjoyed by nearly all players. And some champions are generally hated, even without a good reason. So in this post, I&#8217;ll go over the 10 most popular champions in LoL from the beginning of the game up to this point!</p>



<p>Keep in mind that it&#8217;s totally possible for your champion to not be on the list. After all, we all have different tastes and playstyles when it comes to LoL. Some of us like assassins, and some of us only play mages.</p>



<p>However, the 10 champions I&#8217;ve chosen here are the most popular ones in LoL, not only because I say so. I&#8217;ve actually looked at the data behind their pick and ban rate, as well as their general status within the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/why-is-league-of-legends-community-so-toxic/" data-type="post" data-id="9044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">League community</a>.</p>



<p>So, take a look at the top 10 most popular champions in LoL!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Ezreal</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13543" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Ezreal</strong> is statistically the most played and the most beloved champion in League of Legends. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you are an ADC main or not; chances are that you enjoy playing Ezreal. He&#8217;s quite a fun character to be close to, and he constantly says cheesy and funny lines such as:</p>



<p><em><strong>&#8220;Name&#8217;s Ezreal. E-Z-… oh, you&#8217;re dead.&#8221;</strong></em></p>



<p>A big reason why Ezreal is such a famous champion is the fact that he is an all-skillshots champion. It takes focus and skill to carry as Ezreal, so he always gives you a reason to try harder. In short, he is a difficult to master but very fun champion to play. And most people love him!</p>



<h2><strong>2. Lee Sin</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13545" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The second on this list is <strong>Lee Sin</strong>. Since the beginning of League of Legends, Lee Sin has been the favorite champion of nearly all junglers on the Rift. And why shouldn&#8217;t he be? Lee Sin is perhaps the most interesting champion to play and has 4 fun abilities combined into one brilliant champion design!</p>



<p>The thing that most people love about Lee Sin is the fact that this champion is simply unlimited. You can play him for years, yet there will always be something to improve and work on.</p>



<p>For example, you can start by practicing the Insec kick. You can then dedicate time to the Flash kick. And then you can work on your Ghost kick. There are multiple builds and ways to play this champion, so it&#8217;s always fun to jump into a game with him!</p>

<h2><strong>3. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13550" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Thresh</strong> is, to this day, the most unique and the most influential pick in the support role. Thresh paved the way for a new support playstyle that still has the name &#8220;carry supports&#8221; when he first came out. And in season 11, Thresh is still the reigning king of popularity among the support champions.</p>



<p>Thresh has multiple things that make him fun. First of all, his Q is an awesome hook-like ability that gives 9999 satisfaction when you aim at an enemy champion. And his lantern is one of the greatest spells invented in League of Legends. But all of his abilities fit Thresh&#8217;s champion design perfectly, and we&#8217;ll always find him exciting, no matter the meta!</p>



<h2><strong>4. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13546" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Next, we have <strong>Leona</strong>! As much as Thresh is unique in the support role, Leona is the very opposite. She is a standard tank support champion that has never been reworked or changed in any significant way. Leona is simply always powerful and able to carry games by constantly setting up kills for her teammates.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever played Leona, then you know how fun it is to always be the aggressor in the lane. You are the one that dictates the flow of the laning phase, and you&#8217;re the one that needs to engage first. Flying forward with your E and stunning the enemy ADC so your partner can take the kill can&#8217;t be replaced, honestly!</p>



<p>People seem to love her playstyle, and that&#8217;s why Leona is one of the most popular champions in LoL!</p>



<h2><strong>5. Lux</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13548" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Back in the day, before champions like Zoe or Vex existed, <strong>Lux</strong> was the only long-ranged mage we had in League of Legends besides Xerath. She&#8217;s always been such an exciting character to play, thanks to her wonderful ability mechanics.</p>



<p>Anyone who enjoys playing mages in LoL should give Lux a chance. She can be played both as an AP carry and as a support mage. She works well with most team compositions, so you can fit her everywhere.</p>



<p>All of Lux&#8217;s abilities have a low cooldown, and you can practically spam them, which is always fun. And you can use her ultimate to snipe enemies from a safe distance. All in all, a great champion to enjoy League of Legends with!</p>



<h2><strong>6. Vayne</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13551" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Besides Ezreal, <strong>Vayne</strong> has also been one of the most played ADCs. And unlike Ezreal, Vayne is also played in the top lane, especially as a counter to tanks and melee bruisers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vayne has an extremely high skill cap, which means that you must put a lot of time and effort into practicing her before you can actually play her on a decent level. However, Vayne is also highly rewarding if you do know how to play her. And that makes her a very interesting champion to spend your time with.</p>



<p>People also love the fantasy behind Vayne&#8217;s playstyle. She is a shadow hunter that uses tricks like tumble to avoid her enemies and only strike them from a distance. And playing her like that feels very satisfying to most players!</p>

<h2><strong>7. Yasuo</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13552" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Yasuo </strong>is a &#8220;special&#8221; case on this list because he is one of the most hated and most popular champions in LoL. The reason why he is hated is that not too many players are actually good at playing him. And the reason why they love him is that playing Yasuo is a total blast, no matter how good you are.</p>



<p>Yasuo has multiple dashes, a wind wall to block abilities, a tornado, and a game-winning ultimate. But he became so popular because he was the first samurai character we ever received in LoL. He embodies so many characters that we love from anime, which is one of the biggest connections why players love Yasuo.</p>



<h2><strong>8. Irelia</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13544" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Irelia</strong> has been a part of League of Legends since the very beginning. And even before her rework, she was one of the most popular top lane picks in the game. Currently, Irelia is a much more difficult champion to play, but that&#8217;s why she is even more fun too!</p>



<p>Irelia is a blade dancer, a creating plays with her often feels like doing art. Connecting two blades to stun your enemies and dashing all around with your Q feels very satisfying. People love the fact that they can outplay nearly anyone as Irelia, so they play her a lot too!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>9. Miss Fortune</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13549" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Miss Fortune </strong>is another ADC champion with skyrocketing popularity in League of Legends. And even though she&#8217;s never been reworked and has a fairly simplistic ability kit, we simply love playing her!</p>



<p>The most satisfying part of playing Miss Fortune is her ultimate, Bullet Time. This has always been one of the scariest abilities in the game, simply because it can kill all 5 enemy opponents if used correctly. We often play Miss Fortune just for the chance to score a pentakill with her R. And even though it doesn&#8217;t happen every game, we&#8217;re satisfied with double and triple kills too!</p>

<h2><strong>10. Lucian</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13547" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And in the last place, we have <strong>Lucian</strong>. Lucian has been such an instrumental part of the marksmen&#8217;s design that we often see him as a primary example of how these types of champions should be created.</p>



<p>Lucian was released during season 3. And since then, he&#8217;s been one of the most fun ADCs to play. His passive, which allows him to double-shot after every ability, is simply awesome. His dash is a fantastic tool for avoiding damage, and his ultimate is loaded with an insane amount of damage.</p>



<p>Lucian is the original gunner on Summoner&#8217;s Rift, and he&#8217;ll remain to be so in the years to come!</p>



<p>Those are the top 10 most popular champions in LoL!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Have you ever outplayed, out-smarted, and out-gunned the enemy champion in your lane, and just when you are about to close in for the kill with that final perfectly timed attack, a teammate of yours that happened to be lurking nearby swoops in and steals the kill? I bet you have and you know how irritating that can be. To do all the hard work and then have someone else steal all the glory right before your eyes. This is called Kill stealing or KS-ing for short.</p>



<p>This is a phenomenon not just in League of Legends but in other games as well. In some games, the experience and gold or in-game currency you earn depends on the damage you did and not whether not the final killing shot was by you. However, in League of Legends, all of the gold goes to the killer and that can make it frustrating. Good team-mates will not steal your kill but if you have a toxic cry-baby among your ranks, you can expect a lot more KS-ing.</p>



<p>Sometimes, during team fights, it&#8217;s often not clear who is going to get the final kill when everybody on your team is trying to kill everyone on the enemy team. KS-ing can be forgiven in such scenarios. When you are chasing down an enemy and he seems to be getting away from you, a teammate coming to ensure the kill should not really be considered KS-ing. At times, the support to the AD-carry sets up the kill but ends up taking the kill. If that happens only once in a while, it&#8217;s not KS-ing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if the support is continuously trying to take your kills if someone from your team withholds using his high-damage abilities and uses them only when the enemy is at very low heath, that is the textbook definition of KS-ing.</p>
