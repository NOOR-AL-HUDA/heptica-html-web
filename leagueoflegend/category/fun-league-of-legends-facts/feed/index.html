										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Go on and ask any League of Legends player about what &#8220;<strong>Scripting</strong>&#8221; is. He&#8217;ll probably tell you hundreds of different scenarios in the game that all seem &#8220;unfair&#8221; to some extent. But, what is the general perception of scripting in LoL and what it really is &#8211; things don&#8217;t quite match.</p>



<p>The chances are that by now, you&#8217;ve probably been called a scripter in a match where you played exceptionally well. Although flattering, that isn&#8217;t even close to what a real &#8220;script&#8221; can do for you. And if you have no prior experience with scripting, then the simplest way to put it is that it&#8217;s a form of&nbsp;<strong>cheating</strong> (just like <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-stream-sniping-and-why-does-everybody-hates-it/" data-type="post" data-id="9286">stream sniping</a>).</p>



<p>But the scripts in League of Legends differ from the cheats in any other game for multiple reasons:</p>



<ol><li>LoL is a pretty complicated game, and the hacks here require much more work to develop.</li><li>There are ten active players in every game of League, and since they&#8217;re alive people, their actions vary every time you enter the Rift.</li><li>The scripts in League&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to work flawlessly for that person to win the game.</li></ol>



<p>Because even if you&#8217;re playing an ADC and stomp your bot lane with a script, the enemy mid laner could be 15-0 in a score at the 10th minute and destroy you with one ability!</p>



<p>So how do scripts manage to take all this into consideration and still find ways to give players victories? Let&#8217;s see what exactly scripts do in-game and how the different types of scripts work!</p>



<h2><strong>What Do Scripts Do in A Game?</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="898" height="508" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/953083537-script-lol-league-of-legends-att-10-12-anti-ban-7PSV.jpg" alt="Riot Games is having an endless battle with numerous scripters in the game.

<p>Generally, the scripts transform the player into a perfect AI that dodges and aims abilities at the perfect time. These cheats are built on concrete mathematics that takes into account every variable in the game, from the champion&#8217;s specific cooldown time to the enemy champion&#8217;s hitbox and much more. Then, through algorithms, the cheat finds a way to either hit an ability or move enough pixels away to successfully dodge an ability. This all happens in unreal timing, and the easiest way to assure someone is scripting is by observing their unnatural reaction times.</p>



<p>If we take Faker, for example, and his god-like skill of dodging stuff, we can see that he succeeds either by predicting the enemy&#8217;s aim or reacting to the spells&#8217; visual animations. But the scripts work entirely differently! Since they&#8217;re &#8220;robots,&#8221; they don&#8217;t need to &#8220;see&#8221; the ability in order to dodge it. On the contrary, in the first split second that the incoming ability is fired, the script will turn your champion opposite its destination. And the same goes for hitting skill shots. The scripts are typically 99% accurate when it comes to aiming too.</p>



<p>But that is not all. Most scripts come in a whole package, and the person using them sees all the information on his screen. Champion&#8217;s attack range, enemy&#8217;s abilities range, ward duration, jungle camp spawn times &#8211; literally everything. The scripts can display if the enemy jungler hides in a bush and is waiting for a gank. Or, they can just remove the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1d05xn/fog_of_war_how_exactly_does_it_work/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fog of War</a>&nbsp;and show the entire Summoner&#8217;s Rift &#8211; that&#8217;s called ghosting.</p>



<p>Almost all scripts come with their own specific software or a program, which can be tweaked to do more or less stuff. So if a challenger player that is naturally good at the game activates a script and sets it only to show him the whole map, it will be significantly harder to realize that he is cheating. And the opposite of that, a bronze player that dodges all skill shots and gets a pentakill while being full hp will be more than an apparent cheater.</p>



<p>But most frequently, the scripts in LoL come in three types.</p>



<h2><strong>What Are the Different Types of Scripts in LoL?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jeg_video_container jeg_video_content"><iframe title="TOP 25 MEMORABLE SCRIPTERS/CHEATERS |  League of Legends Montage" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EtQWsJmE3pw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<h3><strong>1) Utility Scripts</strong></h3>



<p>The utility scripts are based around the dodging and hitting of abilities. As we mentioned earlier, the real difference between a simple dodge and a script is in the timing and the precision. A player with a utility script will never move a pixel left or right if it isn&#8217;t absolutely necessary. And also, he will always turn in the opposite direction just at the ideal time.</p>



<p>Almost all champions can be played with a utility script, but Xerath and Ezreal are the ones people usually go for. Typically, these champions have tons of damage if their abilities are aimed right &#8211; which is precisely what the script does.</p>



<p>It is very tough to win against someone who can never make a mistake. People typically get very tilted when playing against a utility scripter because all of their actions ultimately end up useless. And while there is no correct way to win against them, a good tactic is to get as near as the scripter&#8217;s champion (even on top of them) and try to kill them. Because that way, you maximize your chances to hit your skill shots while giving little to none possible algorithms for the script to find a way and dodge them.</p>

<h3><strong>2) Champion Scripts</strong></h3>



<p>The champion scripts are tied with specific champions in the game that have unique but powerful mechanics. For example, the Draven catching his axes, the Kalista jumping around, and the Cassiopeia hitting ulti at the right time. So the champion script will make sure that Draven catches every single ax during the game, that Kalista dodges everything, and that Cassiopeia never loses a duel.</p>



<p>Contrary to the utility scripts, the champion scripts usually work for one champion specifically. But suppose we have a <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-vaynespotting/">Vayne</a> that uses this sort of hack, and you&#8217;re playing against her. You&#8217;ll never be able to attack her without getting stunned first. Not only will Vayne be at the ideal spot 100% of the time, but the champion script will also activate her E &#8211; Condemn almost instantly.</p>



<p>And the same goes for Twitch, Kog&#8217;Maw, or any other champion using this cheat. For example, Lee Sin will always get you with an inSec, regardless of how you try to avoid that.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3) Awareness Scripts</strong></h3>



<p>And an awareness script is usually a maphack, wallhack, and everything else in one. It usually displays right on the enemy&#8217;s health bar the cooldown of their Summoner&#8217;s Spells, as well as which abilities they have ready. The awareness scripts can also show the accurate ranges of each spell in the game, so you can accordingly move out of the way.</p>



<p>But perhaps the most powerful feature of the awareness scripts are the red lines that connect the user&#8217;s champion to the 5 enemy champions. So whenever the opponent gets near, the person&#8217;s using the script will have a red line between his champion and the opponent&#8217;s, regardless if he is in the Fog of War, brush, or anything else. This way, the cheater can always run away to safety before even the ganker gets near.</p>



<p>Such a massive advantage in League of Legends is very unfair. And what is worse, unless the player makes it really obvious, it&#8217;s challenging to realize that they&#8217;re scripting</p>

<p>Yes! There are actually tons of unique cheats that tackle only one or two problems, but they can be very easily spotted. For example, some cheats refresh the cooldowns of Summoner&#8217;s Spells or an active item, so the person using them can flash ten times in a row. And even though these are &#8220;simpler&#8221; cheats, they can be OP and very hard to win against.</p>



<p>Other cheats have features like &#8220;Instant Zhonya&#8217;s,&#8221; which means that if you purchase Zhonya&#8217;s Hourglass in-game, the cheat will automatically activate it when you&#8217;re in trouble. Or &#8220;Auto Bot,&#8221; which means that a bot will take over your screen and play while you&#8217;re AFK.</p>



<p>Then, some cheats work outside of the game. For example, there are loads of hacks like &#8220;Auto Accept Games,&#8221; then &#8220;Blind Pick Instalock,&#8221; &#8220;Username Changer,&#8221; and many others. Note that even these, which aren&#8217;t tied with the gameplay performance, are still bannable, and you can get in a lot of trouble for using them.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Tell if Someone is Scripting?</strong></h2>



<p>Since scripts are quite popular these days, it&#8217;s highly possible that you&#8217;ve come across a scripter in one of your ranked games, and if I have to guess, you probably lost and got upset because he dodged every single skillshot&#8230; am I right? Well, there are a couple of ways to figure out whether your opponent is using scripts, and the first one is their movement. Are they doing weird or robotic-like moves? If they are, it&#8217;s highly possible that they&#8217;re using a scripting software. </p>



<p>The second one is if they&#8217;re able to land every single skillshot. Most scripters like to play with Xerath because he can easily carry ranked games because he can deal massive amounts of damage from a safe distance, and Xerath is the best champion for something like that. It&#8217;s pretty rare that a real person can land every single ability with Xerath because they&#8217;re very hard to land, but a script can do that without a problem. </p>



<h2><strong>Final Word</strong></h2>



<p>Cheating is never an option in League of Legends. Riot Games put a particular emphasis on hacking and scripting, so unless you want to purposefully get punished, then we advise you to stay away from these programs. Sure, they might seem tempting to try them out, and you might get away for a while, but your account will ultimately end up banned for a lifetime.</p>



<p>Scripts are unfair means to <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-quickly-climb-the-league-of-legends-rank-ladder/" data-type="post" data-id="8671">climb up the ranked ladder</a> in LoL without putting in the needed work. And as such, they&#8217;re looked down upon by nearly everyone who takes LoL seriously. It is much better to be a noob and to want to learn the game rather than pretend to be a pro and destroy the game for everybody. We trust you to do the right thing! <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/league-of-legends-slang-terms-and-their-meanings/" data-type="post" data-id="8792">GLHF</a>!</p>

<p>Oh yes, you knew we were going to include Azir on this list. Azir is one of the most <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/mechanical-champions-you-need-to-master-in-lol/">mechanically intense LoL champions</a> on the block. He might just be the highest skill cap in the game. If you ever tried Azir, you’d understand what we mean when we say his mechanics are different than the other champions …much more different.</p>



<p>When you play on Azir, not only do you have to position him correctly, but you also have to tend to his soldiers. This is the type of League champion that has a variety of playing styles for you to try.&nbsp;<strong>Once you have mastered this champion, while it’s difficult, you could carry the entire team.</strong></p>



<p>In order to master Azir, it’s going to take some time because you need the right timing, movement, and positioning of the character.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8836" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-561x331.jpg 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-1122x662.jpg 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-364x215.jpg 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-728x430.jpg 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-608x359.jpg 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-758x447.jpg 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-1152x680.jpg 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league-313x185.jpg 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/hardest-champs-to-master-in-league.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Next on our list, we have Zed – the master of the shadows. With his shadows, there are so many different movements, repositions, and combos to use, so it will take some skill to master this one and use those shadows to their full potential.</p>



<p>Once you have mastered Zed, you will be able to take on any enemy and win, regardless of who you’re up against. Mind you, like the other LoL champions on this list, mastering Zed isn’t going to be an easy journey. In order to master him, you will need to know how every champion in League operates (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-many-champions-are-in-league-of-legends/">there are 153 champions in total</a>) so that you can predict what their next move is going to be.</p>



<h2><strong>8. Kalista</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8840" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-561x331.jpg 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-1122x662.jpg 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-364x215.jpg 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-728x430.jpg 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-608x359.jpg 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-758x447.jpg 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-1152x680.jpg 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends-313x185.jpg 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/most-mechanical-champions-in-league-of-legends.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Kalista is an excellent ADC champion and is very mechanically advanced. Kalista’s auto-attacks aren’t able to be canceled, which is something many Kalista newbies struggle with. Playing this LoL champion will require a lot of mobility and positioning experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you know what you’re doing with Kalista, playing this champion can be a lot of fun. Knowing when to use Kalista’s E is key to playing her – as is knowing which targets to focus.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>7. Riven</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8837" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-561x331.jpg 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-1122x662.jpg 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-364x215.jpg 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-728x430.jpg 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-608x359.jpg 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-758x447.jpg 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-1152x680.jpg 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends-313x185.jpg 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>When we first tried Riven, we were surprised by her high skill cap, so she definitely deserves a spot on this list of the highest skill cap champion in LoL. If you choose Riven as your champion, you need to take time to learn her animation canceling, auto-attack canceling, abilities, combos, and all of the other tricks she has up her sleeves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her animation canceling isn’t exactly easy while you’re trying to balance your kit.&nbsp;<strong>With every Q, you can auto-attack cancel, and use Tiamat for more combos.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In order to fully carry with Riven, you need to know how to play her to your advantage and gain a lot of gold.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>6. Yasuo</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8838" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-561x331.jpg 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-1122x662.jpg 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-364x215.jpg 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-728x430.jpg 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-608x359.jpg 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-758x447.jpg 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-1152x680.jpg 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league-313x185.jpg 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/highest-skill-cap-champs-in-league.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Yasuo’s mechanics are quite intensive, so you can expect to have a lot to work with. Yasuo is usually picked up by low-elo players, so many look at him as a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/9-easiest-league-of-legends-champions-to-learn/" rel="noreferrer noopener">newbie LoL champion</a>, but this isn’t exactly true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The playstyle of a gamer that has mastered Yasuo will be a lot different from that of a newbie. Yasuo’s kit isn’t difficult to play, but it is one of the most difficult ones to master.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>League of Legends is a free-to-play game, and though it doesn’t require money to play, you’ll certainly find yourself dishing some out for skins. The Skins are unique variations of existing Champions that offer new looks, effects, animations, etc. Players love to argue that League is not free to play due to the existence of said Skins. It is a common joke among the community as the Skins have no actual impact on the gameplay. They may intimidate your opponent, but I think having your Champion on Level 7 with many points is much better. But that’s just me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Skin Store is ever-growing and abundant. There are literally so many skins that I don’t think I’ve seen all of them in the game during my time with it. And speaking of not seeing Skins in the game, there are some that just never appear. They are the Skins that were available for very limited times ages ago or in very special and hard to access events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is what we’d call a Rare Skin. It is a Skin that almost no player in the game has and often sells for obscene amounts of money. Some of the ones that we will list here fetch prices up to a few hundred dollars apiece.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I decided to exclude Victorious and <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-hextech-skins/" data-type="post" data-id="9833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hextech Skins</a> from this list. Despite being rare and hard to obtain, a good number of players have them. Hextech skins can even be bought, though very rigorously. I will speak of these skins at the end of the article, as a few deserve mention. </p>



<p>So, let’s begin with our 15 Rarest Skins in League of Legends. (Disclaimer: This list is in no particular order, as measuring actual rarity in numbers is impossible).</p>



<h2><strong>1. King Rammus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-king-rammus-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13961" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-king-rammus-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-king-rammus-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-king-rammus-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-king-rammus-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-king-rammus-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-king-rammus-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-king-rammus-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-king-rammus.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Most of the Skins on this list are gonna be super old. But King Rammus is even older than old. This Skin was granted to players that participated in the Closed Beta of League of Legends way back in October 2009. Ever since the Beta ended on October 21<sup>st</sup>, this Skin was gifted to the players. Being older than the public release of the game itself, it had a very limited spread among those super lucky to be present in those times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Skin itself, though, offers very little. If it were released in current times, I’d wager that Nintendo would file a copyright infringement lawsuit against Riot. Why? Well, it basically makes him look like Bowser. It is just a lazy recoloring of the Champion and has nothing else special about it. It is ultra-rare, and profiles owning this Skin can go for up to about 60 bucks.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Young Ryze</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-young-ryze-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13969" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-young-ryze-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-young-ryze-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-young-ryze-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-young-ryze-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-young-ryze-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-young-ryze-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-young-ryze.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This Skin was once known as Human Ryze. Its rarity comes from the fact that it was awarded to players that pre-ordered the Collector’s Edition of League of Legends back in 2009. As I’ve said above, League of Legends is a free-to-play game, and there is no reason someone should pay for it. Well, some players have paid for it and received some goodies in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve only found a single estimate saying that about 65 thousand players have received this Skin. That means that it is beyond rare when you consider the hundreds of millions that played the game throughout its history. As with most of these super old skins, nothing other than the physical appearance is changed. It is a dull Skin that offers nothing new and imaginative, but its historical nature makes it rare and sought after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve searched around for a price and found one listing of a level 30 profile that owns the Skin. It went for about 130 euros.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>3. Black Alistar</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-black-alistar-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13957" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-black-alistar-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-black-alistar-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-black-alistar-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-black-alistar-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-black-alistar-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-black-alistar-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-black-alistar.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Black Alistar is an identical case as the Skin mentioned previously. It was bundled together with some other Skins as a reward for those that pre-ordered League of Legends Collectors Edition. Similar to King Rammus, this Skin is just a recoloring of Alistar’s original model. It changes up only his physical appearance and brings nothing new to the table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I decided only to include two of these Skins from the Collector’s Edition bundle. Making a list of rare Skins, I wanted to create a diverse list of as many different Champions and Skins as possible. It would take up half of this list if I’d included all of them. However, without detailing them here they are: Huntress Sivir, Goth Annie, and Silver Kayle. Out of all of these, only Goth Annie changes some particle effects, and that’s it. Their rarity is immense, yes, but their quality is non-existent. Black Alistar profiles can go up to 250 euros, making it one of the more expensive on this list. The rest have comparable prices that go from 100 to 200 euros.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Urfwick</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-urfwick-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13968" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-urfwick-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-urfwick-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-urfwick-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-urfwick-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-urfwick-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-urfwick-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-urfwick.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Urfwick Skin is a fun one and is surrounded by some interesting stuff. It was an April Fools release in 2010. The Skin is based on a canceled Champion concept called Urf the Manatee. Most of you will recognize that name from the URF game mode, where spatulas and manatees are plentiful. Riot had an April Fools joke to tell with the Champion concept, but never intended to release it. This saddened fans and, in an attempt to please them, Riot made a Skin for Warwick that too released on April Fools. It features Warwick wearing a Manatee’s corpse as an outfit. It was first listed for 5000 RP in the Store, making it the most expensive Skin in League of Legends history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout its existence in the Store, it was discounted for a week to a mere 50 RP, then upped to 500 and then back to 5000 RP for a weekend. All of the proceeds were donated to a charity that prevents Manatee hunting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Skin made a resurgence in 2017. and was listed for a whopping 150 thousand Blue Essence in the Store. This obscene price made the Skin excruciatingly hard to get, and most players didn’t even bother. I was one of these players, and I am kind of sorry that I didn’t at least make an attempt at it. Anyway, this Skin and its existence are a fun piece of League of Legends’ massive history. Despite not giving the player any new effects and animations, it is valuable, fetching upwards of about 250 USD.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>5. PAX Sivir</strong></h2>

<p>Everyone knows PAX, the world-famous video game event that’s held annually. Well, back in the day (between 2009 and 2011, to be precise), Riot would gift the attendees a Skin Code for one of the specially tailored Skins of that year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2011. Riot gave out the PAX Sivir Skin, giving her a futuristic and Tron-like vibe. She wears biker gear and has a neon; cyberpunk look to her. Well, as you may know, not everyone plays League of Legends. And that was the case at PAX events back then as well. Perhaps even more so, as League was just starting to garner a large player base.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Riot gave out these Skin Codes, most of them remained unused and, in all likelihood, expired. Some players that didn’t find a purpose for them tried to sell them, and sell them they did. These codes fetched huge prices, some even going for over $200. The PAX Skins were in great demand. I remember around 2013. When everyone wanted to buy a PAX Skin, but none were obtainable. Even those that went for hundreds of dollars. Apart from this one, there were two more made, which I will cover next.</p>



<h2><strong>6. PAX Jax </strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pax-jax-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-13970" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pax-jax-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pax-jax-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pax-jax-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pax-jax-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pax-jax-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pax-jax-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pax-jax.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Those who attended PAX in 2010. were gifted the PAX Jax Skin Code. This is perhaps the most sought-after of the PAX skins. At least it has been in my experience with the game. Whenever I looked up the PAX Skins around 7 to 8 years ago, Jax would be the one that stood out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is based on a webcomic made by PAX and sports a PacMan-looking symbol on his back. He looks a lot like the Skin Angler Jax, and I always coped for not having the PAX one with it. It offers nothing new but changed looks (which seems to be a reoccurring theme in this list). But I just love it. The simplicity and yellow color suit Jax’s character well, and I’d love to have one. The name also is music to my ears, and it seems like Jax is best fitted for this alternate look. Accounts with this Skin can cost you over 500$ a piece, which tells you a lot about its demand.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>7. PAX Twisted Fate</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-league-of-legends-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13956" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-league-of-legends-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-league-of-legends-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-league-of-legends-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-league-of-legends-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-league-of-legends-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-league-of-legends-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-league-of-legends.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The PAX Skin older than all is the PAX Twisted Fate, gifted to the first 20 thousand attendees of PAX 2009. It gives Twisted Fate a very different look. He sports a black and blue color combination, as well as a mix of gray. It doesn’t change his other animations or anything else, but I reckon you already guessed that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When those attending the show were given the Skin Code, most decided to sell it as it was ultra-rare. Prices went up as high as $450 per Code, making it one of the most expensive Skins sold second-hand. I’ve found some Accounts that have it, along with some other ultra-rare skins, that cost around 3 to 4 <strong>thousand</strong> dollars. This is an insane amount to pay for a dull Skin, so don’t even think about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All Skin Codes are irredeemable today, as the system was disabled way back in 2014. Those who managed to score these Skins today own a great piece of League of Legends history and gaming history in general. Some may even find a way of scoring a few bucks on them if they find the right buyer.</p>



<h2><strong>8. UFO Corki</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-ufo-corki-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13967" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-ufo-corki-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-ufo-corki-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-ufo-corki-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-ufo-corki-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-ufo-corki-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-ufo-corki-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-ufo-corki.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This Skin was part of a brief promotion around the New Year in 2010. It was gifted to all players that registered in the game before January 14<sup>th,</sup> 2010. Players also received the Champion Corki along with the Skin. As the name suggests, it fits Corki into a UFO and changes his physical appearance. Other than that, it changes nothing, making it a very basic and bland skin. You might notice that these older Skins make little to no changes to the Champions. It was a reoccurring theme that spanned from the cheapest to the most expensive Skins at the time. We are sure glad that changed over the years, and we got some of the most amazing Skins in any video game ever. It can be found for very cheap, though, and I noticed some accounts going for about 30 euros.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>9. Rusty Blitzcrank</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-rusty-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13966" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-rusty-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-rusty-blitzcrank-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-rusty-blitzcrank-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-rusty-blitzcrank-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-rusty-blitzcrank-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-rusty-blitzcrank-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-rusty-blitzcrank.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This is an odd one, if not funny. It was released on November 20<sup>th,</sup> 2009, making it part of some of the oldest skins in the game. But, unlike most Skins, it was removed from the game abruptly after a short period of availability. Riot never exactly explained why it was removed, but most believe that the texture quality was poor, and it <strong>literally looked like the original</strong>. When you look up screenshots of this Skin, I bet you wouldn’t even notice a difference at first glance. It basically was a waste of RP, and it was about 520 RP at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite being an awful, removed, and useless Skin, accounts can go for up to about 70 USD. Insane, I know, but people will buy almost anything these days.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>10. Riot Squad Singed</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-riot-squad-singed-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13965" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-riot-squad-singed-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-riot-squad-singed-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-riot-squad-singed-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-riot-squad-singed-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-riot-squad-singed-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-riot-squad-singed-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-riot-squad-singed.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This reimagining of Singed as a member of Riot’s representative police force is certainly a nice one. Despite changing nothing in terms of animations and sound effects, it does provide a nice facelift to an otherwise basic Champion. It changes his flask into a huge grenade, and he sports the Riot Games logo all around him. The most prominent of these logos is situated on his shield and has a unique look. There are many Riot Skins in the game, and the line has been used to promote the company, etc. But, among all of them, Riot Squad singed is the rarest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He was only obtainable during the Gamescom 2010 event where players were gifted the Skin Code. For a time after the event, the Codes were traded around, but due to 2014. Discontinuation of Codes in general and the Codes’ low demand make the Skin one of the ultra-rares. I’ve looked around and saw accounts with it going as high as $200, though it can likely be found for less.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>11. Judgement Kayle</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-judgement-kayle-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13960" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-judgement-kayle-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-judgement-kayle-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-judgement-kayle-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-judgement-kayle-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-judgement-kayle-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-judgement-kayle-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-judgement-kayle.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Perhaps the rarest of all the Skins you’ll see on this list, Judgement Kayle is rather beautiful. Though it does not change effects (go figure), it does offer a fantastic combination of blue and white that you could look at forever. It was given to players that played 10 games in Season 1. Due to the very low player count back then, the Skin was awarded to scarcely anyone. I’d consider myself very lucky if I happened to own this one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With not much to say about her other than that, the Skin can be found going for about $50.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>12. Pumpkinhead Fiddlesticks</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pumpkinhead-fiddlesticks-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13964" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pumpkinhead-fiddlesticks-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pumpkinhead-fiddlesticks-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pumpkinhead-fiddlesticks-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pumpkinhead-fiddlesticks-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pumpkinhead-fiddlesticks-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pumpkinhead-fiddlesticks-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-pumpkinhead-fiddlesticks.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>It really is suiting that I’m writing this article during Spooktober, and this Skin happens to pop up. The Pumpkinhead Fiddlesticks is spooky indeed, and it changes Fiddlesticks from a regular scarecrow into a, well, <em>spooky</em> one. It replaces Fiddle’s head with a Pumpkin and alters his clothes. A simple skin, yes, but one loved by many players. It is considered by many to be the best Skin for Fiddle, though I’d disagree on that point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Skin was released during the Harrowing event back in 2010. The event was a Halloween special that runs to this very day, and the one in 2010. was its inception. Those that were around back then would’ve acquired this Skin, but as many of us started playing a while earlier (most notably Seasons 2 and 3), we’ve missed out on it. However, those who do have it have a real treat of a Skin that got even better with Fiddle’s recent rework. I saw an account going for about $200 with this Skin. Is it worth it? Probably not.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>13. Championship Riven</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-championship-riven-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13958" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-championship-riven-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-championship-riven-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-championship-riven-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-championship-riven-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-championship-riven-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-championship-riven-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-championship-riven.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Finally, a skin that actually adds something to the Champion. Championship Riven is a Skin that was made to celebrate the 2012 World Championship. Being the first in the Championship lineup, she is also the rarest. For a limited time, and I mean <em>very</em> limited, the Skin could be bought for 975 RP. It was also awarded to those who purchased tickets for the 2012 Worlds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Skin Code trading was prevalent during those days, most players opted to sell the Skin on 3<sup>rd</sup> party websites. Then, prices went up over $300 to $400 per Code, an insane amount for a single 975 RP Skin. It adds a lot of blue and black effects to Riven’s usual green spells and has some other animation changes as well – such as the recall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2016. Riot released the Championship bundle that contained all of the Championship Skins at that time and included Riven in there. Riot updated the Legacy Skin to honor the original fans and even gave the players their own loading screen banner. Today, Accounts with Championship Riven can go for about $500 and upwards, depending on what other rare Skins they might have on there.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>14. Medieval Twitch</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-medieval-twitch-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13962" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-medieval-twitch-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-medieval-twitch-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-medieval-twitch-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-medieval-twitch-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-medieval-twitch-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-medieval-twitch-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-medieval-twitch.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Medieval Twitch was given as a reward for referring friends. It was designed by two League of Legends players that reached 350 referrals first, a record that remains unbeaten to this day. And it cannot be beaten, as the referral system no longer exists. It makes Twitch look, well, medieval, giving him new armor and weapon textures. Though considered super rare, its rarity dwindled with the introduction of Capsules, Chests, etc. I happen to own one myself, and while researching the topic, I was surprised to find out just how rare it is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I couldn’t find how much it might go for, but I think it wouldn’t be as expensive as others on this list.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>15. Grey Warwick</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-grey-warwick-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13959" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-grey-warwick-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-grey-warwick-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-grey-warwick-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-grey-warwick-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-grey-warwick-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-grey-warwick-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/rarest-skins-in-lol-grey-warwick.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>I’m talking about this Champion last due to a very complicated situation it is in currently. It was rewarded to players that referred a lot of their friends. It was a very demanding task, it took a great deal of effort to achieve this and be rewarded with a rare and unobtainable Skin. In recent years (since the changes to the Honor system), the Skin’s rarity has died off. Riot decided to award this Skin to all players that reach Honor Level 5. This made it readily available, especially for new players that could climb through Honor Levels with little to no effort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As with the prior Skin, I happen to own one as well. Riot’s free handouts of some of these rare Skins that at some points were a real chore to get angered some of the player base. Whatever you think of the Skins, they are nothing special. This one turns Warwick into an elderly werewolf and gives him a mask. That’s it. It won’t go for much, as it is not as rare as it used to be, but it still is not easy to have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>A word on Victorious and Hextech Skins</strong></h2>



<p>I decided not to include these in the list for several reasons:</p>



<ol><li>Their number is way too large to fit into the list. It is a top 15, and when combined, they are well over 15 in total.&nbsp;</li><li>They are not as rare as you think. Gemstone drop rates have improved, and you can still buy Chests, keys, etc. that improve your chance of getting some. Many players are also Gold each season, millions in fact, and I don’t have anything else to add there.</li><li>They have no real history. I mean, seriously, they just exist and are “considered” rare due to their relative difficulty of obtaining. Other than that, there’s not much to be said about them.</li></ol>



<p>If you like these Skins (and believe me, I do), I’m sorry for excluding them. They are just not part of a broader League of Legends story that’s been told ever since 2009. and continues to expand.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Skin rarity is insanely hard to measure. I had scarcely any tools at my hand other than a few sites that tremendously eased the research process. These are: <a href="http://unrankedsmurfs.com">Unrankedsmurfs.com</a>, <a href="https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Esports_Wiki">Leaguepedia</a>, and L<a href="https://lolskinshop.com/">olskinshop</a>. Check them out to read up on details about some other Skins you might find interesting, as well as their prices. Warning: the prices tend to be shocking, and I suggest you prepare yourself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We love to hear from you, and I put extreme efforts into creating these long and detailed lists and guides. Feedback can only help me improve, so make sure to leave any critique you might have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone likes speed. Even more so when that speed means you can pummel opponents with attacks so fast, they wouldn’t even know what hit them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>League of Legends offers a large variety of attack speed items to suit your best needs. This particular buff is built into every role in the game, and there are barely any Champions that wouldn’t enjoy a little speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I compiled what I believe are the best overall attack speed items based on what they offer. Flat attack speed is not the only determining factor, but what surrounds it is the key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, without dragging on for too long, ready your <strong>Frozen Hearts,</strong> and let’s begin with our list.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>5. Guinsoo’s Rageblade</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="520" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guinsoo-rageblade-best-attack-speed-items-1024x520.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13131" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guinsoo-rageblade-best-attack-speed-items-1024x520.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guinsoo-rageblade-best-attack-speed-items-300x152.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guinsoo-rageblade-best-attack-speed-items-768x390.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guinsoo-rageblade-best-attack-speed-items-150x76.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guinsoo-rageblade-best-attack-speed-items-750x381.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guinsoo-rageblade-best-attack-speed-items-1140x579.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/guinsoo-rageblade-best-attack-speed-items.jpg 1174w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>A staple attack speed item, Guinsoo’s has been extra insane since the item changes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a +40% attack speed, it will make your attacks blazing fast. But that is not all this item has to offer. It modifies your critical strikes, making them a lot more potent than you’d think was normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It offers a +20% critical attack and an incredible passive ability called <strong>Wrath</strong> that converts critical% into bonus on-hit Damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It also has another passive <strong>Seething Strike</strong> that amplifies your on-hit effects by 100% after you stack it up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you thought <strong>Master Yi</strong> was strong before, you’ve seen nothing yet, as this item makes hard-hitting fighters like him almost impossible to deal with without an intense defense build.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>4. Phantom Dancer</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="510" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-phantom-dancer-1024x510.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13129" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-phantom-dancer-1024x510.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-phantom-dancer-300x149.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-phantom-dancer-768x383.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-phantom-dancer-150x75.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-phantom-dancer-360x180.jpg 360w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-phantom-dancer-750x374.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-phantom-dancer-1140x568.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-phantom-dancer.jpg 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Another on-hit speed demon is the ol’ reliable Phantom Dancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The item provides you with a flat increase of +25% Attack Speed but doesn’t end there. It has solid extra modifiers: +20AD +20% Critical Strike Chance and +7% movement speed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This item not only empowers the speed at which you hit – but the hits themselves as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The passive makes things even better. <strong>Spectral Waltz </strong>grants 7% bonus movement speed on-hit and a stack of <strong>Spectral Waltz</strong>. When at four stacks, your next attack consumes them and gives you <strong>an extra 30% Attack Speed.</strong> This incredible modifier puts the item at a total of +55% attack speed when in combat. Paired with the sum of +14% movement speed, you’ll be running through the enemies quicker than the wind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phantom Dancer received many changes throughout the years but remained one of the best attack speed items to date.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Trinity Force</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="586" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-trinity-force-1024x586.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13130" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-trinity-force-1024x586.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-trinity-force-300x172.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-trinity-force-768x439.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-trinity-force-150x86.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-trinity-force-750x429.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-trinity-force-1140x652.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-trinity-force.jpg 1182w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>I’d never miss an opportunity for a good pun, and I just <em>had to</em><strong><em> </em></strong>put Trinity Force at number 3. This item, unique as it is, is one of the oldest in the game. Like Phantom Dancer, it received numerous overhauls and updates, but its core mechanics remained the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Mythic machine will enrich your Champion with a vast number of effects and modifiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It grants +35 AD, +20 Ability Haste, +30% Attack Speed and +200 Health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The passive <strong>Threefold Strike</strong> grants +20 movement speed on-hit for 3 seconds and a +6% base damage increase stacking five times for 30% when attacking Champions and structures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Sheen</strong> is part of this item’s build path, so naturally, the <strong>Spellblade</strong> passive is present. It will empower your next attack after using an ability for 200% of your base AD, making this item a <strong>heavy</strong> hitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a Mythic, it will enchant your <strong>Legendary</strong> items with a bonus of 3 AD, 3<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/difference-between-ability-haste-and-cooldown-reduction/" data-type="post" data-id="9901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ability Haste</a>, and 3 Movement speed. You will not only move and attack quickly, but cast spells just as fast. </p>

<h2><strong>2. Blade of the Ruined King</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="593" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-blade-of-the-ruined-king-1024x593.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13127" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-blade-of-the-ruined-king-1024x593.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-blade-of-the-ruined-king-300x174.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-blade-of-the-ruined-king-768x445.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-blade-of-the-ruined-king-150x87.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-blade-of-the-ruined-king-750x434.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-blade-of-the-ruined-king-1140x660.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-blade-of-the-ruined-king.jpg 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Though the Ruined King is now in the game, the item precedes him for almost a decade. This old beast will not only speed you up, but in the like of Guinsoo’s, shred through the enemy’s health bar so fast no sustain will be able to save them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only will you strike hard and fast with the +40AD and +25% Attack Speed, but you will also heal for quite a bit with the additional +10% Life Steal this item offers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the real charms of the Ruined King’s weapon are the passives (as is mostly the case in items since the overhaul).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first passive – <strong>Mist’s Edge – </strong>make you deal 10% of the enemy’s current health as bonus on-hit damage (reduced to 6% for ranged Champions). The maximum bonus damage is 15 for all units and 60 for minions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can combine this item with other bonus on-hit damage boosters for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/lethality-league-of-legends-how-does-it-work-updated/" data-type="post" data-id="7321" target="_blank">lethal</a> quick damage that will only take a few basic attacks to finish off most Champions. </p>



<p>The second passive (that used to be an active spell) is <strong>Siphon.</strong> It stacks up to three times. The third stack consumes the rest, dealing 40-150 (based on level) bonus magic Damage on hit and slowing the target by 25%. It also boosts your movement speed for the same amount, making for easy rundowns of escaping enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are few items in the game as powerful as BOTRK, and this has remained true for years and will remain for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Kraken Slayer</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-kraken-slayer-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13128" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-kraken-slayer-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-kraken-slayer-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-kraken-slayer-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-kraken-slayer-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-kraken-slayer-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-kraken-slayer-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-attack-speed-items-kraken-slayer.jpg 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Last but not least is the go-to ADC item in the current patch. There won’t be a single game where you won’t see this item, and for a good reason. It is a well-rounded, immensely powerful Mythic item that grants incredible modifiers that best suit the ADC role, though many other Champions can fashion it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This hooked menace will provide you with +65 AD, +20% Critical Strike Chance, and a solid +20% Attack speed increase. But, as with most items in this list, it doesn’t stop there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The unique passive <strong>Bring it Down</strong> stacks on hit, up to two stacks. The third attack consumes them to deal 60 + 45% bonus AD of True Damage at two stacks. True Damage ignores all defenses and chunks health bars of even the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-tanky-mid-laners/" data-type="post" data-id="12308" target="_blank">tankiest </a><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-tanky-mid-laners/" data-type="post" data-id="12308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">j</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-tanky-mid-laners/" data-type="post" data-id="12308" target="_blank">uggernaut</a>. </p>



<p>What makes this item the best of the best in terms of attack speed is the Mythic passive that, in my opinion, should be nerfed as soon as possible. It empowers all of your Legendary items with an extra +10% attack speed. Yes, you’ve read that right.</p>



<p>This means that at a full build with 4 Legendary items, this item alone would make for a +60% flat Attack speed increase, combine that with other powerful attack speed items listed above, and you’ll reach the 2.5 cap in no time.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Also read: <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-burst-champions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Burst Champions in League of Legends</a></strong></p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Attack speed in this game is something anyone can build, but some roles and Champions capitalize on the most. Roles such as ADCs and heavy-hitting fighters are best suited for this buff, though others can utilize it in various ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems like <strong>Riot Games</strong>, for no apparent reason, decided to make this category of modifiers very, very broken. As we can see in the examples above, and especially in <strong>Kraken Slayer</strong>, reaching the 2.5 Attack speed cap is super easy, and if you sport the <strong>Lethal Tempo</strong> rune, you’ll be at Attack speed levels you didn’t even know existed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, alas, we can only hope for a nerf. Until then, however, we can discuss what our favorite Attack speed items are. Let us know if your favorites are in this list, why you’d include them if they weren’t and if you think that they should be nerfed at all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We always love to hear your thoughts, so don’t miss out on letting us know what you think about this list.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Playing the support role is a job that goes unnoticed at times, but that’s okay because we supports know what we’re doing (usually). This is okay because this also means the enemies don’t recognize the support champions very much, which means they don’t put a whole lot of focus towards you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you haven’t already, I recommend you choosing support as one of your mains. Why would you choose support as a main? Well, long story short, maining support can help&nbsp;you <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/league-of-legends-elo-hell-how-to-get-out-of-it/">climb from low Elo</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many LoL players find the support champions a bit on the boring side, so they go for the other roles – this is understandable. However, luckily, not all of those support champions are on the boring side. Believe it or not, there are actually some fun LoL support champions you can pick. I recommend choosing one of the support champions that you like the most and using him/her to boost your rank, if that’s what you need.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of the support champions are mechanically intensive, which can be surprising. As long as you’re able to get used to the strategies and combos, playing support can be a whole lot of fun…in fact, it can be just as fun as any other role.</p>

<h2><strong>1. Pyke</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9248" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-561x331.jpg 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-1122x662.jpg 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-364x215.jpg 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-728x430.jpg 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-608x359.jpg 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-758x447.jpg 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-1152x680.jpg 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps-313x185.jpg 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/league-most-fun-supps.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Pyke has an ability that sets him apart from the other support champions, and it comes in the form of his R. There’s an AoE execute that resets, and let me tell you, it is super fun to use, especially in the support role, because it shares kill gold. Pyke is assassin support, and we all know how fun assassins can be – him being an assassin in the support role is what sets him apart from the others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pyke has everything (well almost everything) you’d want – he has plenty of <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8923">CC</a>, and if done right, he can deal a lot of damage, and then there’s the outplay potential. Regardless, Pyke is relevant in all parts of the game, and you’ll never find yourself sitting there at your desk yawning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pyke is one of the most fun support champions in League of Legends – go ahead and give him a try if you don’t believe me.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Taric</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9246" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-561x331.jpg 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-1122x662.jpg 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-364x215.jpg 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-728x430.jpg 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-608x359.jpg 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-758x447.jpg 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-1152x680.jpg 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league-313x185.jpg 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-supports-league.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Next on our list, we have Taric – <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/league-of-legends/league-of-legends-downfall-taric-rework#:~:text=Back%20to%20Top-,League%20of%20Legends%20Taric%20rework%20officially%20revealed%2C%20the%20Gem%20Knight,making%20his%20entire%20team%20invulnerable.">Riot reworked this champion</a>, and hands down, it’s one of the best reworks they’ve done. This LoL champion has many utility and CC to hide behind and works great with other hyper-carries. Did I say Taric is a tank? Of course he is – he is capable of taking a lot of damage while providing shields and heals for his team members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Word of advice – when it comes to Taric, it is crucial to keep track of his mana. If you sit there and spam too many skills, you’re probably not going to get very far. Also, make sure you make full use of his passive. Thankfully, even if you were to use Taric half-decently, he will still be powerful, which is half the reason why he’s so fun.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Karma</strong></h2>

<p>Just the name “Karma,” alone, sounds fun. Karma is the type of LoL champion that is competent in almost every situation. If you’re the type of player that is looking for a versatile and safe support Champion, then Karma is the route you’ll want to take. Her R is used to empower her other abilities, her Q does major damage, her E is for a group-wide shield and movement speed boost, while her W is used for long root and healing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She does a great job in skirmishes, but this doesn’t mean she isn’t a threat in team-fights. If you find yourself being placed with teams who just group mid after the laning phase, that’s okay, because Karma is fully capable of clearing waves on those side lanes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Zyra</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9247" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-192x108.jpg 192w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-384x216.jpg 384w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-364x205.jpg 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-728x409.jpg 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-561x316.jpg 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-1122x631.jpg 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-608x342.jpg 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-758x426.jpg 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-1152x648.jpg 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10-313x176.jpg 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fun-to-play-support-champions-in-season-10.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Zyra is another fun LoL support champion that you’re going to want to try out. She’s technically a mage, but she fits just fine into bot lane though, better than she fits in mid lane. She has reliable CC that’s easy to use – when you combine this with her crazy burst potential; you’re going to have a lot of fun. Oh yeah, and a great poke!</p>



<p>After she picks up 2 or 3 items, she becomes a real monster (that’s always fun). She can easily pick off enemy champions and tilt them. Regardless, Zyra brings a lot to the table and can carry the game if you feed her enough.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9249" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-561x331.jpg 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-1122x662.jpg 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-364x215.jpg 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-728x430.jpg 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-608x359.jpg 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-758x447.jpg 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-1152x680.jpg 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports-313x185.jpg 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lol-fun-supports.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>When a player does the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypnEEtHCyX8">Flash+Hook combo</a>, it takes the breath out of everyone (if he lands it). I remember when Thresh first showed his face, many people picked him up because he made the support class fun. He has a decent hook hitbox, making it pretty easy to land. I’d say the only difficulty is to land that one game-changing hook. Other than that, he’s definitely a fun support champion that you should try out.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>So, there you have it, the five most fun support champions in League of Legends. The one you choose is entirely up to you, but our personal favorite has got to be Pyke.&nbsp;<strong>Some other fun support champions that you may want to try out are Shaco, Predator Nunu, Singed, Miss Fortune, and you can’t forget about cute little Teemo!</strong></p>



<p>What about you? Do you have a personal favorite support class that is a load of fun?</p>

<p>When the “Realms of Runeterra” was released, we got to learn new and exciting things about the LoL champions, such as their age and weight. For those of you who aren’t familiar with “Realms of Runeterra,” this is an encyclopedic-style book that explores League of Legends epic lore. The book was published as a way to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Have you ever wondered how old Amumu was? How about how much Alistar weighs?</strong>&nbsp;<em>Continue reading as we take you through a journey of the age and weight of each LoL champion.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Take note that the age of the champions comes from the book, but the weight is a concept. Not all of the champions will have their age because “Realms of Runeterra” doesn’t list all the champions. Also, the ages are calculated from 9000BN until 96AN (Before and After Noxus’s foundation).</p>

Her wings weigh about 10 pounds per pair (she has six of those things).</li><li>Kled – 3’0 and 40 pounds.&nbsp;</li><li>Poppy – 3’2 and 50 pounds. Compared to the other champions, she’s tiny, but don’t let that fool you because she’s strong and stocky under that armor.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Sion, Singed: <strong>Somewhere between</strong></strong> <strong>81-209 years old</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Sion – 9’ and 1.5 tons. You know, because metal does weigh a lot.</li><li>Singed – 6’3 and 140 pounds.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Swain, Master Yi, Gangplank, Kassadin, Illaoi, Gragas, Malzahar, Udyr, Xin Zhao, Urgot, Teemo and Vex: <strong>Somewhere between</strong></strong> <strong>41-50 years old</strong></h2>

He could be a bit taller.&nbsp;</li><li>Urgot – 10’ and 2000+ pounds.</li><li><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/why-do-league-players-hate-teemo/" data-type="post" data-id="8396">Teemo</a> 2’8&#8243; / 0.81m</li><li>Vex  2’8&#8243; / 0.81m</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Shen, Draven, Zed, Jayce, Viktor, Yasuo, Senna, Lucian, Shen: 33-35 years old</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Jinx, Vi: 21 years old</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Jinx – 5’3 and 98 pounds.</li></ul>



<p>· Vi – 5’9, and 140 pounds.</p>



<h2><strong>Sejuiani, Taliyah, Ashe: 23 years old</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Sejuiani – 6’0 and 185 pounds. You don’t want to mess with this champion, trust me.</li><li>Taliyah – 5’9 and 140 pounds.</li><li>Ashe – 5’9 and 145 pounds.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Ekko: 17 years old</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Ekko – 5’9 and 130 pounds. He may be a tad bit shorter than this.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Akali: 19 years old</strong></h2>



<p>Akali -5’3 and 110 pounds. Her height comes from her K/DA bio.</p>



<h2><strong>Nunu, Annie: 8 years old</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Nunu – 4’4 and 63 pounds. Basically, the size of your average eight-year-old boy with some Freljord genes tossed in there.</li><li>Annie– 4’2 and 58 pounds. The same as Nunu, Annie is the size of your average eight-year-old girl.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Kai’Sa, Qiyana, Sona, Lux, Orianna, Kayn, Ezreal: 20 years old</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Kai’Sa – 5’6 and 140 pounds. The height comes from K/DA site, saying she’s under 5’7. The suit she’s wearing is skin-tight, but it contains gauntlets and all of that fun stuff, which is probably 10 pounds.</li><li>Qiyana – 5’0 and 107 pounds.</li><li>Sona – 5’6 and 120 pounds. The size of Marilyn Monroe.</li><li>Lux – 5’10 and 140 pounds. Lux is pretty tall.&nbsp;</li><li>Orianna – 5’8 and 170 pounds. This champion could be shorter, but it’s hard to tell, so we’ll say 5’8 to be on the safe side.&nbsp;</li><li>Kayn – 6’0 and 145 pounds. He’s much taller than Zed in the comic, but it could be his hair, we’re not sure.</li><li><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-build-for-ezreal-in-urf/" data-type="post" data-id="9313">Ezreal</a> – 5’8 and 105 pounds. He’s still a teen.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Miss Fortune, Nidalee, Leona, Shyvana, Jarvan IV, Diana, Taric, Garen, Caitlyn, Riven, Sivir, Cassiopeia, Quinn, Tryndamere, Fiora, Karma, Vayne: 25-31 years old</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Miss Fortune – 5’6 and 120 pounds.&nbsp;</li><li>Nidalee – 5’6 and 120 pounds. She’s an athletic woman.</li><li>Leona – 6’1 and 195 pounds. This champion is muscular and matronly. She’s a true beast, no doubt, but we’re not walking up to a 6’1 woman and asking what her weight is, so we’ll guess 195 pounds.</li><li>Shyvana – 5’6 and 140 pounds in human form. In dragon form, 18’ and 6’ long, weighing 1500 pounds.</li><li>Diana – 5’10 and 150 pounds. She’s on the tiny side, but don’t let this fool you because Diana is pretty strong.</li><li>Taric – 6’2 and 245 pounds. What you have here is pure masculinity.&nbsp;</li><li>Garen – 6’5 and 220 pounds. The armor probably adds around 100 pounds. In-game, his sword is exaggerated and probably weighs 15 pounds.</li><li>Caitlyn – 5’7 and 125 pounds. Caitlyn has to be fit enough to be able to toss a person to the ground. She seems a bit taller than 5’7. But that’s probably because of her hat and boots.</li><li>Riven – 5’11 and 160 pounds. She’s almost as tall as Draven.</li><li>Sivir – 5’8 and 125 pounds. We’re thinking Greek proportions here.</li><li>Cassiopeia – 13’ and 380 pounds.</li><li>Quinn – 5’8 and 140 pounds.</li><li>Tryndamere – 6’1 and 160 pounds. This champion&#8217;s right arm is stronger than the left.</li><li>Fiora – 5’11 and 160 pounds. She may be a bit lighter than this.</li><li>Karma – 5’8 and 135 pounds. She’s about the same height as Irelia, but she has less muscle mass than her.</li><li>Vayne – 5’9 and 140 pounds. We heard that tumbling is a great exercise.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>It’s always exciting learning about characters in a game, especially when you play the game so much. Personally, we have always wondered about Warwick&#8217;s age and weight, and now we know. Which champion surprised you the most?</p>

<p>League of Legends is a popular game – before the match starts, you have to select which champion you will be using and take it from us; there are many champions for you to choose from. They range from heroic warriors to swift assassins, and everything in between the two. If you choose, you can fight as a shape-shifting dragon or a tree …yes, it’s that cool.</p>

<p><em>How many champions are in League of Legends?</em> <strong>Right now, there are a total of 157 champions</strong>, with the latest one being <strong>Vex</strong>. <strong>When League of Legends was first released back in 2009, there were 40 champions</strong>, and from there, new champions have continuously been added.

<p>Personally, we love playing as an assassin, because they can deal a nice amount of damage in no time at all. When you play a champion and know how to use the combos, taking out another player isn’t hard. Right now, there are a total of 21 assassins in League of Legends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marksmen are capable of quickly dealing damage from a distance. So, if you’re the type of player who doesn’t like to get up close and personal with the enemy team, this would be a good class for you.&nbsp;<strong>There are a total of 25 Marksmen.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are various kinds of disables in League of Legends. These include stuns, suppression, silences, slows, fear, and more. Each one can be equally frustrating if you get caught in them and equally fun if you manage to get your enemies caught in them.</p>



<p>League of Legends has a knack for a very smooth learning curve for new players but has layers of depth in the game that pro-players are still discovering, exploring, and talking about. New players find it easy to learn League of Legends, whereas pro players have lots of opportunities to explore new mechanics in the game.</p>



<p>Some players have alleged that smite can be used while being stunned. Similarly, others have argued that summoner spells can be used while being stunned; the logic there is that stuns work on the champion but not on the summoner or player (YOU!), so summoner spells are safe to use while being stunned. Another debate that can be found on Reddit and other chat forums is whether or not you can use smite while under the effect of Zhonya&#8217;s active.</p>



<p>Then again, the summoner spell that is possible to be used under a stun actually varies from spell to spell. The same is true for all the different kinds of disables i.e. the summoner spell that can be cast while under the effect of a particular disable depends on the disabling effect as well as the summoner spell.</p>



<p>There could be an entire article about how to get free from different kinds of stuns. For example, Silence stops Flash and Teleport but not others. As far as the possibility of using Smite while being stunned is concerned, you can try it for yourself. Many users have said that it&#8217;s entirely possible to use smite while under the effect of stun. <strong>The only disabling effect that can stop you from casting Smite is &#8220;Suppression&#8221;.</strong></p>



<p>But such is the beauty of League of Legends. There are so many layers to this game that it&#8217;s safe to say they have not yet been explored entirely. As the game develops from season to season, new game mechanics are evolving, and there is more and more to explore in League.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sion is probably one of the most unique champions that you can play within League of Legends. Building upon the archetype of the undying brute who is built to take damage-come what may-Sion is a favorite of players who like to play a tank in the top lane. More recently, players have experimented with him in the bot-lane as support as well.</p>



<p><strong>Also read: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/inting-sion-build-a-complete-guide/" data-type="post" data-id="9564" target="_blank">Inting Sion Build – A Complete Guide</a></strong></p>



<h2><strong>Sion&#8217;s Abilities</strong></h2>



<p>Sion&#8217;s passive is called &#8220;Glory in Death&#8221;. If Sion is killed, his dead body is reanimated to fight nearby enemies. However, after dying, his revived corpse has rapidly declining health but can hurt enemies more based on their missing health and can also regenerate health from inflicting damage on enemies. His &#8220;Q&#8221; i.e., the Decimating Smash, can knock up enemies if sufficiently charged. His Soul Furnace (His &#8220;W&#8221;) creates a shield around him and can be reactivated to inflict magic damage on nearby enemies. With his &#8220;E&#8221; (Roar of the Slayer), he can reduce the Armor of enemies who are caught in his line of attack. And finally, his ultimate is the Unstoppable Onslaught. He can dash a long-distance and knock up enemies who get hit in the way. The damage dealt to enemies is based on the distance of Sion&#8217;s dash.</p>



<p>All that being said, a lot of the times Riot has some mechanics hidden in champion abilities. You can&#8217;t simply read off menus and player guides to discover these mechanics. Sometimes you just have to find out for yourself by playing League and experimenting in different ways. For example, Sion&#8217;s ultimate may have some hidden effects as well, such as damaging turrets.</p>

<h2><strong>Does Sion&#8217;s Ultimate damage Turrets?</strong></h2>



<p>Sion has a very unique Ultimate in that he dashes a long-distance across the map and knocks up and damages the first enemy hit. Often when Sion begins his dash with &#8220;R&#8221;, the sound effect of his ultimate is heard across the map and sends enemies panicking and looking over their shoulders because SIon can come from a very long distance with Unstoppable Onslaught. But the hidden mechanic mentioned earlier is the fact that you can damage enemy turrets using Sion&#8217;s Ultimate.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jeg_video_container jeg_video_content"><iframe title="AD Sion ult on Nexus Towers" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0Yj_o7_8gc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>This ability allows Sion for a lot of back-door potentials during the late game because Sion can dash across half the length of the map to damage enemy turrets. In the early game, it just means you can rush in and take down enemy turrets more quickly. Either way, you can pile up the pressure on the enemy team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ever since Riot Games&#8217; biggest title came out, a war between the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiplayer_online_battle_arena_games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MOBA games </a>has erupted. And if we are to pin down the key differences between Dota 2 and League of Legends, we will need to consider all aspects of the genre.</p>



<p>LoL, and Dota 2 are the most popular video games in this field. Both of them have masses and masses of followers, although one surpasses the other. However, their style of play, their pace, their characters are nowhere the same. Anyone who has tried their hand at both League of Legends and Dota 2 can tell you how different of an experience they provide.</p>



<p>Here we will examine the key points that make the most significant differences between Dota 2 and League of Legends. So let&#8217;s start with their history!</p>



<h1><strong>The Key Differences Between Dota 2 and League of Legends</strong></h1>



<h2><strong>1. History</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lol-vs-dota-history-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10704" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lol-vs-dota-history-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lol-vs-dota-history-300x169.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lol-vs-dota-history-768x432.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lol-vs-dota-history-750x422.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lol-vs-dota-history-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/lol-vs-dota-history.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>It might be well known that Dota 2 didn&#8217;t start as a standalone game. Back in the days when there was no League of Legends, Defence of the Ancients was just a game mode in Warcraft III. Now, WC3 was a big hit worldwide, so the mode quickly overtook the world. It introduced a 5v5 PvP arena with much complexity and &#8220;fairness&#8221; where friends can battle their way to glory through both strategy and skill.</p>



<p>Years forwards, Valve purchased the rights for Dota from Blizzard. They rebranded it into Dota 2 and removed every bit of Warcraft III from their game. New hero designs, new looks, new names… It launched on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and soon became one of the biggest Esports scenes. And even though the game has almost no similarity, the die-hard fans of WC3 can still spot all the similarities between Dota 2 and its former self.</p>



<p>On the other hand, League of Legends wasn&#8217;t created by random strangers that liked a challenge. Rumors are that many of the developers that worked on Warcraft III and World of Warcraft at Blizzard during that time transitioned over to Riot Games to work on LoL instead. Of course, Dota&#8217;s game mode wasn&#8217;t supported in any way by Blizzard, so it was only a matter of time when a team would want to flash out its potential.</p>



<p>So, LoL was created to provide a unique, authentic, and powerful 5v5 PvP experience. In the start, it had many trials and errors, but with time Riot Games and the community have made it to what it is today &#8211; the loudest name in the world of Esports!</p>



<h2><strong>2. Design</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="512" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differences-between-league-of-legends-and-dota-2.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10699" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differences-between-league-of-legends-and-dota-2.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differences-between-league-of-legends-and-dota-2-300x150.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differences-between-league-of-legends-and-dota-2-768x384.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differences-between-league-of-legends-and-dota-2-360x180.jpeg 360w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/differences-between-league-of-legends-and-dota-2-750x375.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>When I say graphics, I mostly mean the entire technical aspect of the game. I start with this because you undoubtedly wonder if you can even run a game before downloading it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>League of Legends runs on a proprietary engine built by <strong>Riot Games</strong> themselves. It is notoriously easy to run on a variety of systems, even those older ones. Being a game released in 2009. this is a no-brainer, and though it did receive some graphical/technological updates, the game remains a non-demanding title that most people can play without much issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>League of Legends recommends a 3GHz CPU, at least 4 Gigs of RAM, and a DirectX 9.0c GPU with <strong>at least</strong> 512MB of Video Memory.</p>



<p>DOTA 2 is a different story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DOTA 2 runs on the Source 2 Engine built by <strong>VALVe. </strong>Despite the Source engine’s reputation of performing well on hardware that’s even a <strong>decade</strong> old, the upgraded Source 2 version is a bit more demanding than its predecessor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DOTA 2 was initially built on Source 1, which is good news for people with older hardware who would like to check the game out. Other than some infrastructural things, DOTA 2 takes barely anything from the new and updated Source 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even so, it is much more demanding than the alternative. Those who expect at least 30 to 45 FPS in League should expect a 30% decrease in performance in DOTA 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DOTA 2 has impressive graphics and a great map, making the FPS trade-off worth it for some eye candy connoisseurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DOTA 2 requires at least a dual-core CPU running at 2.8GHz or higher, 4 Gigs of RAM, and a DirectX 9.0c GPU or better. We can see that DOTA 2’s minimum requirements are that of what League recommends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have the hardware, give both games a try and see which one performs better for you before making premature judgments.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Heroes and Champions</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-vs-dota-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10702" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-vs-dota-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-vs-dota-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-vs-dota-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-vs-dota-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-vs-dota-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-vs-dota.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Now, the playable characters in both of these games are termed differently. LoL has its champions, and Dota 2 has its heroes. When you first start playing League of Legends, you&#8217;ll see that you have a limited champion pool to choose from. And you&#8217;ll have to work towards unlocking more and more characters. However, in Dota 2, you have all heroes unlocked at the start, so you can pick whichever you want to main right away.</p>



<p>But perhaps the biggest differences between the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-many-champions-are-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8630">LoL champions </a>and the Dota 2 heroes are their complexity. With an unbiased conclusion, we can safely say that the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/10-most-appealing-female-league-of-legends-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8976">League of Legends characters</a> are more challenging and difficult to play.</p>



<h4><strong>Why is this?</strong></h4>



<p>Well, the style of play in League of Legends is such that most champions are designed on one fundamental &#8211; skill shots. Skill shots are abilities that you need to aim, either at a targeted location or a chosen trajectory, rather than just pressing them directly onto the enemy. Think of Ashe&#8217;s R or Mirana&#8217;s arrow. And based on percentage, League of Legends has much, much more skill shots than Dota 2.</p>



<p>Another element that comes into play is the fact that more heroes in Dota 2 have passive abilities in the place of the active ones. Traditionally in LoL, every champion has an active spell on the Q, W, E, and R buttons, while all having a passive effect that defines their playstyle.</p>



<p>This, however, doesn&#8217;t mean that there are no difficult heroes in Dota 2. It merely shows that there are more straightforward picks there instead of League of Legends.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Roles</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/roles-in-lol-and-dota-2-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10705" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/roles-in-lol-and-dota-2-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/roles-in-lol-and-dota-2-300x169.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/roles-in-lol-and-dota-2-768x432.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/roles-in-lol-and-dota-2-750x422.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/roles-in-lol-and-dota-2-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/roles-in-lol-and-dota-2.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>One of the biggest differences between Dota 2 and League of Legends are their rules on roles and builds.</p>



<p>In Dota 2, they exist only vaguely, though. Every team needs to have a carry and somewhat of a <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-off-meta-supports/" data-type="post" data-id="8869">support</a>. They&#8217;re helped by constant ganking of all the other members of the team and vice versa. The heroes are of either of the three categories: Strength, Agility, and Intelligence. Each has its own build path and ways to deal with its enemy.</p>



<p>But in League of Legends, there are fixed rules for every role! The top laner should almost always be a tank or at least a melee fighter who can endure many hits. The mid laner is responsible for doing as much damage as possible with a mage or an assassin style of a champion. In the bot lane, there is always a ranged carry champion and a supportive one. They both work towards the same goal of getting the carry as powerful as possible. And lastly, the jungler is responsible for roaming everywhere and enabling his lanes for success.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Gameplay</strong></h2>

<p>Okay, both of these games are MOBAs, sure, but their gameplay differs by <strong>a mile</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>League of Legends is more or less a simplified version of the original DOTA All-Stars custom map. At first, it was chaotic, and roles were a lot closer to what was present in DOTA, but as time passed, League grew into an orderly game where everyone had a part to play.</p>



<p>This detailed development of roles and Riot’s active influence on creating a particular gameplay system in their MOBA alienated League from its alternative. Of course, the roles in League of Legends are Top-Mid-Jungle-Bot, a structure that Riot blatantly works on keeping, cutting down any divergence from it (i.e. Funnel, 3 Bot, etc.).&nbsp;</p>



<p>League of Legends is faster, the map is smaller, and the overall game lasts a lot shorter. The Champions are all structured around one of the roles mentioned above and, though there can be some versatility, most fall within a mold that Riot envisions for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DOTA 2 remained true to its predecessor and expanded upon the formula. The same developer who created the DOTA map – <strong>Ice Frog </strong>– is the lead developer for the map’s continuation, allowing for a more authentic experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DOTA 2 is built on chaos, and though there are roles, they are played in ways unimaginable to your average League of Legends player. There are usually two supports in the game, and many Heroes (the counterpart to Champions) can perform the role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ice Frog tends to design Heroes closer to specific roles than others, but there is no single role assigned to any Hero in the game. Some are just better at things than others, and versatility is universal for most.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The map is almost twice the size of that in League. The overall pace is slower (but does get fast towards the later points in the game). The games usually last about an hour or more, depending on the game mode you’re playing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DOTA 2 offers many different game modes to play and even custom ones. League’s <strong>TFT</strong> was created as a custom game mode in DOTA 2, then called <strong>DOTA Autochess</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of variety, versatility, and freedom of gameplay, DOTA 2 is the king. Keep in mind this can create incredible disorder and lead to unbalanced teams that can suffer significantly to even remain dormant throughout the game, let alone win it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take your time to evaluate what fits you better: order and pre-determined cohesion or chaos and variety/versatility of gameplay. I suggest you spend at least a few hours on both to experience all the games have to offer.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>6. Community</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-community-popularity.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10700" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-community-popularity.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-community-popularity-300x169.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-community-popularity-768x432.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/league-of-legends-community-popularity-750x422.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>It is no secret that League of Legends has a bigger <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/did-you-know-total-league-of-legends-player-count-updated/" data-type="post" data-id="6960">player base</a> than Dota 2. It is also a more popular Esports scene, which additionally draws in more and more players to try out the game.</p>



<p>But generally, League of Legends tends to have a younger audience than Dota 2. As an older title, Dota 2 has amassed years and years of experience, so it&#8217;s a bit hard to get into right now. On the other hand, League of Legends is very accessible, easy, and fun at first sight, so anyone can give it a shot!</p>



<h2><strong>7. Difficulty</strong></h2>



<p>As the simpler one, League is much easier to get into and play. The roles are there to guide you into what you like to do, and there is a solid system in place to introduce new players to the game.</p>



<p>DOTA 2 is notoriously hard to get into. It is complex, the itemization system tends to be confusing, and there are barely any proper introduction systems to ease new players in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of the difficulty in DOTA 2 lies in its complicated nature. The patches tend to change the game entirely, shift and move the map around, etc. It can be frustrating as a new player to start getting used to things only for Ice Frog to pull a 180 and revert/change everything put in place up to that point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though challenging, DOTA does offer a fantastic experience that League can barely replicate at times. Still, despite playing both games intensively, sometimes I want to relax and play a simple <strong>blind pick</strong> on the <strong>Rift</strong> and not worry about things.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>It would be futile to say which game is better, as they differ enough to be their own thing despite the similarities in genre and some gameplay aspects. My advice to any new players trying out both games is: Slow it down, enjoy what is offered, and try out as many things as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do not make the mistake of rushing to slam or praise the games. They represent marvels of modern game design and the multiplayer concept in general, with millions playing them each day, with numbers only increasing as time goes on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At any rate, both are great from my point of view. Some may disagree and look to start a war between the two (as is often the case with the internet), but I just like them both in their own way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We love to hear your thoughts on all topics we write of, so don’t miss out on letting us know which one you prefer and why.</p>
