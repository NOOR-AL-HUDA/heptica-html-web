<p>Teamfight Tactics is Riot Games’ auto battler game, also known as TFT. Similar to DOTA 2’s Auto Chess, Teamfight Tactics pits you against seven other players as you recruit powerful champions and deploy them to the field for battle. TFT matches are usually shorter than a Summoner’s Rift match, so the surrender timer is also different for the game.</p>



<h2><strong>When Can You Surrender?</strong></h2>



<p>You can surrender in a TFT match after the 10-minute mark. The 10-minute mark should be around the 9th battle, where you are supposed to battle three krugs, also called Round 2-7, the last battle of Round 2. Before you get to this point, you will have to go through Rounds 1 and 2, including 3 PvE battles (excluding the krugs), 5 PvP battles, and two carousel rounds.</p>



<p><strong><em>Once you reach the 10-minute mark, you can surrender at any time.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong>How to Surrender in TFT</strong></h2>

<p>Surrendering in TFT is similar to surrendering in a League of Legends match. There are two main ways to go about it:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Pressing the Surrender button in the menu after pressing Escape</strong></li><li><strong>Typing “/ff” in the chatbox, as well as other variations like /surrender, /concede, or /forfeit</strong></li></ul>



<p>Note that unlike surrendering in League of Legends, surrendering in TFT does not require a prompt from the other players. Since TFT is a single-player game, you are simply leaving the current TFT game, and the game you surrendered on will continue for those who are still playing.</p>



<p>With that said, you also cannot start a new match right after you surrender. The client still counts you as “in-game” despite having left, so you will have to wait for a while before being able to start a new match.</p>



<h2><strong>Penalty for Surrendering in TFT</strong></h2>



<p>As a single-player auto battler game, there is no penalty for surrendering in a TFT match. Compared to League of Legends, surrendering in TFT is laxer than a game of League of Legends, where you have to put up with four other people and wait for them to accept defeat and surrender.</p>



<p>With that said, by surrendering, the game immediately places you in the last place among the remaining living players. If you surrender in a ranked TFT game while more than half of the players are left, you would be immediately ranked among the bottom four, counting as a loss and making you lose LP.&nbsp;</p>
