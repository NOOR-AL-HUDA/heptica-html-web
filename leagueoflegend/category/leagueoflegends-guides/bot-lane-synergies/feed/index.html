										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Truthfully, Kog&#8217;Maw has seen better days than season 11. His immobile tool kit is too vulnerable in today&#8217;s meta, where the burst damage is significantly higher than any other season of League of Legends. As a result, Kog&#8217;Maw requires specific supports that can make him viable and set him up for carrying. So in today&#8217;s guide, we&#8217;ll go over the top 3 supports that best suit Kog&#8217;Maw in season 11!</p>



<p>Typically, you want to pair Kog&#8217;Maw with a champion that can protect him. Although tanks can be pretty useful in team fights, they lack the necessary tools to push Kog&#8217;Maw through the laning phase. He&#8217;s got quite a short-range (before level 6) and doesn&#8217;t have any way of escaping CC other than side-stepping.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s talk about the 3 best supports for Kog&#8217;Maw and how to play them!</p>

<h2><strong>1. Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13487" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Since the dawn of time, Lulu and Kog&#8217;Maw have been one of the<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> most feared duos in League of Legends</a>. These two champions have an insane amount of synergy and work perfectly together, almost as if they&#8217;re were created for each other.</p>



<p>The first thing to understand here is how Lulu&#8217;s passive works. Whenever Lulu shields or speeds up an ally, her fae companion Pix will stick around the ally to deal bonus damage on each auto-attack. This mechanic is useful for all champions in the game, but with Kog&#8217;Maw it reaches new heights.</p>



<p>Kog&#8217;s W extends the range of his basic attacks and empowers them to deal bonus max health damage. On top of the additional damage from Pix, these auto-attacks can melt everyone, including tanks. Kog&#8217;Maw&#8217;s build in season 11 is packed with a lot of attack speed, so he doubles the value of these benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all because Lulu also solves every other problem that Kog has a champion. Kog&#8217;Maw has no mobility &#8211; Lulu grants him movement speed; Kog&#8217;Maw is very squishy &#8211; Lulu gives him a shield; Kog&#8217;Maw can&#8217;t block <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> &#8211; Lulu can knock everyone away from him. And that&#8217;s what makes her the best among the supports for Kog&#8217;Maw in season 11!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Morgana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13488" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Morgana is partly aggressive and partly defensive support. What makes her truly terrifying is the abundance of crowd control and the ability to block the enemy spells. The latter is one of the most useful effects in the entire League of Legends, so Morgana is always among the best supports for Kog&#8217;Maw too.</p>



<p>Making Kog immune to CC while he spits powerful attacks that shred the enemy frontline is perhaps the strongest move you can do in LoL. Morgana frees Kog&#8217;Maw to move around the map and engage in team fights. But Morgana can also engage first and open the way for Kog&#8217;s heavy artillery.</p>



<p>Another thing that should be noted here is how well Morgana&#8217;s Q and R synergize with Kog&#8217;Maw&#8217;s skill shots, especially his R. Many ADC players underestimate the damage of Kog&#8217;s ultimate, mainly because it deals magic damage and not physical. But both the base damage and the AP ratio of this ability are seriously insane and Kog can kill anyone with it as long as he has mana.</p>



<p>In the bot lane, Morgana and Kog&#8217;Maw can play aggressively into almost any matchup, as long as Morgana makes good use of her snare and spell shield.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13486" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Janna and Kog&#8217;Maw is a very typical bot lane duo. You generally want to play this matchup as carefully as possible in the first few levels. Kog&#8217;s damage is considerably low in the early game and Janna has only one damaging ability &#8211; her W.</p>



<p>After level 6, this pair becomes more durable. Thanks to his ultimate, Kog can unleash a tremendous amount of damage as long as he is careful about his mana. And Janna has multiple ways of protecting Kog&#8217;Maw. Her shield has a very short cooldown and her ultimate is her reliable plan B.</p>



<p>But in the mid and late game, Kog&#8217;Maw and Janna are even more powerful. All Janna needs to do is to run around Kog&#8217;Maw and spam her shield. And all Kog has to do is deal damage from afar and be careful of the enemy assassins. It&#8217;s easier said than done, but that&#8217;s the principal idea of playing team fights with this duo.</p>



<p>And those are the 3 best supports for Kog&#8217;Maw in season 11!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Everybody knows that Kalista is currently not as strong as she was in some of the previous seasons of League of Legends. Her kit is designed around peeling, kiting, and dealing damage over long periods of time. She lacks instant burst damage and survivability, two of the most important elements of the current meta. And although Kalista can be a solid ADC pick in LoL, you must know which support champions can increase her chance of winning. So today we&#8217;ll go over the 7 best supports for Kalista in season 11!</p>



<p>The most important part of synergizing Kalista with another champion has always been her ultimate. Thanks to this ability, Kalista can bind herself to an ally. And once she has an Oathsworn, she can pull that ally to herself and let them launch forward for a surprising knock-up effect. This creates a complicated web of opportunities for many champions to take advantage of, so Kalista has no shortage of support candidates.</p>



<p>But let&#8217;s talk about the top 7 supports for Kalista in season 11 and explain why they&#8217;re the best choices!</p>

<h2><strong>1. Braum</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="538" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-1024x538.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12698" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-300x158.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-768x403.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-150x79.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-750x394.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-1140x599.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever played Kalista in League of Legends then you know that the best kind of support is the one that benefits from being thrown in the middle of the action. Braum is such a candidate, having an enormous potential to flip the team fight on its head.</p>



<p>Braum brings a couple of benefits to Kalista&#8217;s playstyle. He is an extremely defensive champion and can protect Kalista while she focuses on farming in the early game. But Braum can also engage and, thanks to his passive, provide a stun effect which Kalista can use to secure kills early on.</p>



<p>In team fights, Kalista and Braum can always engage first to create an advantage. By knocking the enemy team up Braum opens an opportunity for himself to use his ultimate. This also allows Kalista to deal a massive amount of damage while all her enemies are crowd controlled.</p>



<p>Obviously, Kalista can also use her ultimate to get Braum out of trouble in case he&#8217;s way too deep in the enemy territory. Then Braum can follow this with his own ultimate, which is also a great tool for disengage.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Alistar</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12697" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>If Braum isn&#8217;t your type of champion or you&#8217;ve never played him, then Alistar should your second choice when considering supports for Kalista in season 11. Alistar is simply amazing in a combo with Kalista, adding one more knock-up and incredible protection for the AD carry.</p>



<p>Similar to Braum, Kalista can always throw Alistar in the middle of the fight and get great results. Alistar doesn&#8217;t have the biggest range in LoL and he often needs a little push forward. What&#8217;s great about these two champions is that not only they can keep enemies in the air for a long time, but they can also push someone away from their team. Alistar&#8217;s W is a great tool for isolating targets, especially the carries.</p>



<p>In the lane, Alistar can defend Kalista from most attackers either by pushing enemies away or passively healing her. He can position himself offensively so the opponents would have to eliminate him first and Kalista second.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14678" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Leona is a tanky aggressive support. Kalista likes this playstyle because it goes well with her. When Leona locks down a target, Kalista can stack her spears into the target, and well, there are options once you reach a certain point. Kalista can leave the trades short and bursty, meaning rinse and repeat until you push your opponent out of lane, opening you up to farm calmly and possibly take tower plates in the early game, or go for an all-in looking for the kill.</p>



<p>Leona is very tanky thanks to her W, meaning she can withstand some damage without losing too much health. This is heavily beneficial in short trades, as it will be tough for the opposing duo to do any significant damage to her.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Pantheon</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14679" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Kalista has a passive effect which deals bonus magic damage whenever she and her Oathsworn attack the same target within 4 seconds. Pantheon has a straightforward way to proc this by using his W, a gap closer and stun. Kalista can then follow up with her own damage to burst a target down and force a recall at the very least.</p>



<p>Pantheon is an excellent pick for Kalista since he has a reasonably strong early game, enabling him to carry through it and allow Kalista to scale by farming and buying her own items. Pantheon’s in-your-face playstyle synergized very well with Kalista.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Galio</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14677" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Galio has quite an aggressive engage on his E. Even if he misses it, it’s more than likely that he’s right beside the target, enabling him to cast his taunt. The real magic, though, is in his ultimate. It has a pretty long cast range, so he can get in and cast it on an ally that finds himself in trouble from afar, and more often than not, save their life.</p>



<p>Combining Galio’s ultimate with Kalista’s, followed by Galio’s E, is a <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control chain</a> consisting of three, yes THREE, knock-ups. Allow Galio to channel his taunt and what you’re left with is a player yelling at his screen bellowing CC needs a nerf.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Amumu</strong></h2>

<p>Thanks to his mini rework, the Sad Mummy has been absolutely wrecking the support role in Season 11. Amumu can abuse his two Q charges to stack crowd control on a target, and his natural tankiness makes him hard to trade with.</p>



<p>However, there is one particular synergy between these two champions when they reach level 6. Kalista’s ultimate allows Amumu to dash into the enemy team, knocking them up, and he can immediately chain this knock-up with his own ultimate, which is an <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AOE</a> stun. This combo is amazing for early skirmishes, late-game teamfights, and everything in between.</p>

<h2><strong>7. Morgana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12699" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>But if a tank isn&#8217;t your preferred playstyle in LoL, then we highly recommend you Morgana in combination with Kalista. Out of all enchanters and mages, Morgana is the one champion that absolutely needs to be in melee range with her enemies. And Kalista&#8217;s R is the perfect setup for that!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever Morgana is launched forward, she can immediately use her own ultimate while the enemies are still airborne. Not only does this help to secure stun on multiple targets but it also creates a chaotic situation for the opposing team. Being knocked up and chained by Morgana is a big disadvantage for you at the start of the team fight, so you want to escape it as soon as possible. And that&#8217;s where Kalista comes into play!</p>



<p>Although her passive is incredible for kiting and running away, it&#8217;s amazing for chasing enemies down too. Hopping after every attack means that you&#8217;ll always be near your prey. On top of Morgana&#8217;s other <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> tools, this is a clean winning combination for Kalista!</p>



<p>Those are the 7 best supports for Kalista in season 11!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Samira is arguably the best ADC champion in season 11 of League of Legends. Her <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/riot-games-and-the-200-years-experience-aphelios-meme-explained/" data-type="post" data-id="9903" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;200 years&#8221;</a> ability kit allows her to not only deal massive damage from afar but to overpower opponents from close range too. Her dash mechanic resets on a champion kill or assist; her wind wall blocks spells in a 360-degree circle, and her lifesteal is often higher than Soraka&#8217;s healing. But all jokes aside, Samira is one of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-one-tricks-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="12402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best champions to main</a> as an ADC and you need to know which supports suit her best in season 11!</p>



<p>The supports that often go very well with Samira are tanks. This is because they can always engage first and create space for Samira to come in second and unleash her ultimate all around. That doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t play an enchanter or a mage with Samira, but you might lose a few engage opportunities if you do.</p>



<p>That said, let&#8217;s talk about the top 7 best supports for Samira!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Alistar</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12838" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Alistar is a classic tank. He&#8217;s got a knock-up, a stun, and a heal &#8211; everything that Samira can ask for. But if you want to utilize this combo to the fullest, then you need to understand how Samira&#8217;s passive works and how she benefits from the presence of Alistar.</p>



<p>Daredevil Impulse allows Samira to dash to any enemy champion if they&#8217;re already in some crowd control effect. But if that is a knock-up, then Samira will also keep that target airborne for 0.75 seconds longer. So each time Alistar goes for a Headbutt + Pulverize combo, Samira can simply right-click the affected enemy to get in range and keep him in the air. This is an extremely powerful mechanic that&#8217;s available from level 1!</p>



<p>Obviously, Alistar has this ability combo available on a fairly short cooldown. This means that he and Samira can repeat this process all the time and grab kills during the laning phase. Alistar&#8217;s stun is also helpful, but Samira can&#8217;t extend that duration.</p>



<h2><strong>2. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12840" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Leona + Samira is one of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/fun-bot-lane-combos/" data-type="post" data-id="11538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most feared bot lane combos</a> in League of Legends. It&#8217;s true that Leona doesn&#8217;t have any knock-up effects, but she brings three separate crowd control abilities to the table &#8211; two stuns and a root. Samira can use all of these effects to dash herself to the affected opponents and start dealing damage.</p>



<p>The strongest point that these two champions have is team fights. Leona is known to be the queen of engaging supports and that&#8217;s not without a reason. Her ultimate can catch multiple enemies off guard and create the perfect situation for Samira. Samira excels in chaotic situations where she can jump forward and activate her ultimate. She can then start executing champions once they&#8217;re pretty low.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Leona can be of great help to Samira when it comes to kiting. Leona&#8217;s Q is another ability of a short cooldown so she can stop the enemies that are going for Samira.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Blitzcrank</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14682" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Steam Golem is a fantastic partner for Samira. As many of you know, Blitz is known for yoinking champions towards his team for an easy pick. Samira can follow this up nicely. By focusing on the target that was picked by Blitz, Samira can easily land a full ability rotation with autos weaved in, leaving her at rank A or S on her passive, ready to smash that R key and obliterate the remainder of the team.</p>



<p>We did mention Samira does well with knock-ups, and Blitz has just that on his E ability. This synergy comes especially handy during the laning phase, where every additional fraction of a second that your opponent cannot trade back gives you an advantage over them.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Braum</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14683" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Given Samira’s tendency to just dive into the enemy team and, well, do Samira things, a support that can follow through and, well, support her is almost a necessity. The Heart of the Freljord can do just that. With his Stand Behind Me ability, he can dash to Samira right after she dives into the enemy team and support her from there.</p>



<p>His ult is an AOE knock-up and slow, making it an excellent tool for engaging and disengaging a fight. His Unbreakable makes him a projectile sponge, shielding Samira and the rest of his team from incoming damage.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14685" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Thresh and Samira have a rather unique synergy. This is because Samira no longer needs to look for the kamikaze plays into the enemy because she now has something she typically lacks: a way out. Thresh’s lantern is precisely for that purpose; it allows Samira to dive into the enemy team, take out a target if she’s able to burst it down, and get out quickly.</p>



<p>Apart from this, Thresh has an excellent setup for Samira; his Q and E both enable Samira to proc her passive to dash into range and poke her opponents. A good Thresh player will be able to earn kills for his ADC and keep her safe from incoming attackers.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Pyke</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14684" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>I guess we have all realized already that Samira is a pretty aggressive champion. In the support role, there really aren’t many supports that are more aggressive than Pyke. He can threaten by simply having his Q available, which will be more than enough to frighten many opposing players. This is because, at this point, everybody knows how scary Pyke can be if fed a few kills early on. Thanks to his ultimate, every kill he is involved in becomes a gold mine, where he shares extra gold between himself and the last ally that assisted in the kill.</p>



<p>Whenever Pyke does choose to go in, a Q E combo will deal enough damage and keep the target stunned long enough for Samira to join in for a pretty heavy trade.</p>

<h2><strong>7. Galio</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12839" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Galio isn&#8217;t the most traditional support champion in League of Legends but no one can argue that he is the very best one for Samira in season 11. All of his abilities are great for aiding Samira, especially his E. This spell knocks up the first enemy (or enemies) hit in Galio&#8217;s path and triggers Samira&#8217;s passive. Thanks to this, Samira and Galio can play quite aggressively in the lane, since Galio has his taunt to keep their opponents in place and secure the kills.</p>



<p>But the most important synergy between these champions comes after level 6. Galio&#8217;s ultimate is an <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AoE knock-up</a> and can be used to protect Samira. And with Samira, he has multiple ways of using this ability, depending on the situation.</p>



<p>For example, Galio can wait for Samira to enter the fight first and get into melee range, then use his R and knock everyone up. This will allow Samira to keep them in the air and get a bunch of kills. Or, Galio can wait until their opponents jump onto Samira to counter-attack their effort and turn the tide of the battle. In the end, he can use this ability on another teammate to engage in a fight so Samira can join right after.</p>



<p>And that makes Galio one of the best supports for Samira in season 11 of League of Legends!</p>

<p>Even though Lucian is more of a mid-lane pick than ADC in season 11, no one can argue that he is still one of the strongest marksmen on Summoner&#8217;s Rift. His base damage is incredibly high and thanks to his simple yet effective ability kit, Lucian can carry most games if played correctly. The build that most Lucian players run currently revolves around Galeforce and one-shotting squishy targets. So if you play Lucian in the bot lane, you need to know which are the best supports for you in season 11 of LoL!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how these 7 different support champions can aid Lucian in the laning phase and outside of it!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Braum</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12904" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Lucian + Braum is one of the most popular <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bot lane combos in League of Legends</a>. Their synergy surpasses that of most other matchups and even rivals that of Rakan and Xayah. And one of the reasons for this lies in their passive abilities.</p>



<p>Braum&#8217;s passive applies a debuff on the targeted enemy which requires 3 auto-attacks or abilities to turn into stun. Lucian&#8217;s passive allows him to double-shot after each ability used which also counts as 2 separate auto-attacks. In combination, both of these champions can work together to instantly stun a target. For example, Braum can throw his Q, and Lucian can quickly dash and use his 2 auto-attacks. This is such an advantage in 2v2 fights in the bot lane, especially early on.</p>



<p>However, Braum&#8217;s wall is another benefit for Lucian. This ability blocks projectiles and it can be used to shield Lucian while he&#8217;s channeling his ultimate. Obviously, Lucian&#8217;s R is one of the hardest-hitting abilities in the entire game, but it can also be interrupted. So Braum for the win!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="577" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-1024x577.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12906" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-1024x577.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-768x433.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-1536x866.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-150x85.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-750x423.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-1140x643.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Thresh and Lucian is another favorite combo for many bot lane duos. People say that Thresh is the perfect support for all marksmen champions in the game. And even if we can&#8217;t agree 100% with that, the truth is that he is one of the best supports for Lucian in season 11.</p>



<p>With Thresh, Lucian can play both aggressively and defensively. Thresh has a lot of tools to outplay his opponents, starting with his Q. This ability can set up Lucian&#8217;s damage and start the chain <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>. Lucian requires crowd control to fully channel his ultimate, so Thresh can help a lot with both his E and R.</p>



<p>The lantern is another element that this duo has. Lucian can go deep into enemy territory or dive on turrets because Thresh can simply throw his lantern and secure an exit for him. On the other hand, Thresh can also go deep and pull Lucian to him whenever he has an enemy locked.</p>



<p>All in all, this duo has a very fun dynamic and it&#8217;s an absolute blast to play. We highly recommend roaming and invading whenever you play Lucian and Thresh since they have enough damage and CC to overpower anyone on the Rift.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14565" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Based on Lucian&#8217;s recent &#8220;rework&#8221; in which his autos are empowered when he is healed, shielded, or buffed, Nami is a great pick to go with the gunslinging sentinel. Her E stacks nicely with Lucian&#8217;s aforementioned passive, granting them a quick burst of damage very few duos can match.</p>



<p>Additionally, Nami provides an exceptional kill setup with her Q and ult, bringing some crowd control to the table. A locked-down target stands very little chance when being burst down by this hard-hitting duo.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14564" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>When talking about locking down a target, there is no way the Radiant Dawn will be left out. Offering a hard-to-beat <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC chain</a> with her E Q R combo, Leona gives Lucian plenty of time to damage a target, which he can easily follow up by getting in range with his own E.</p>



<p>Be careful with this combo, as it is going to be very difficult to counter. Lucian has bonus movement speed if he hits a target marked by his W, and Leona is a very sticky support by herself.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Senna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14566" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>I have to admit I&#8217;m quite a fan of the lore, so seeing this pair synergizing well together does put a smile on my face. The poke they can have with their respective Q abilities is obnoxious, to say the least, add in the fact that Senna&#8217;s Q is a heal, and therefore Lucian&#8217;s passive empowers his autos, and you have a recipe for nightmares.</p>



<p>As if slowly whittling down your opponents from an absurd distance isn&#8217;t enough for you, do remember that Senna scales indefinitely as the match progresses, meaning every couple of minutes, she can harass you from even further down the lane, dealing even more damage every time.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Amumu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14563" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This one may come as a bit of a surprise to many, but the Sad Mummy has quickly become a reliable support ever since his Q was changed. To those who don&#8217;t know, Amumu now has two Q charges. Yes, that&#8217;s right, just after you feel like you should be playing in Korean solo queue because you sidestepped his first Bandage Toss, you get hit by the second charge. Sounds frustrating? Good, because it most definitely is.</p>



<p>Amumu&#8217;s CC and natural tankiness make him difficult to deal with in the bottom lane, as he now has a lot more playmaking potential thanks to that additional Q charge. His ultimate is an absolute beast in teamfights and skirmishes, as it is hard <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> in a wide area and, when an Amumu hits a 5-man ultimate and has a team that can follow that up properly, it&#8217;s a guaranteed ace for that squad.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Nautilus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12905" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Similar to the previous two choices, Nautilus is a &#8220;free win&#8221; support pick for Lucian in season 11. The power of this combo comes from Nautiilus&#8217;s incredible <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control abilities</a> and Lucian&#8217;s damage. And whenever they&#8217;re together, the enemy team should work twice as hard to shut them down.</p>



<p>Nautilus has the most kill potential in the bot lane than any other support champion. Since level 1, he is able to not only grab a champion but to provide a root effect through his auto-attack. This is extremely powerful for invading the enemy jungle or rushing a level 2 fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Nautilus is also great in <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-attack-move-orb-walk-and-kite-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="8678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kiting</a> for Lucian and <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-peel-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peeling</a>. In team fights, the low cooldown on his passive allows him to continually snare targets that are trying to reach Lucian. And combined with his ultimate that knocks up everyone in the lane of the selected target, we can agree that Nautilus can keep Lucian safe.</p>



<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that Lucian should always play recklessly. In truth, Nautilus doesn&#8217;t have any shield or healing to help out Lucian. But if both players understand how these two champions work together, then they can be one of the most powerful pairs in League of Legends.</p>



<p>And those are the top 7 best supports for Lucian in season 11!</p>

<p>Jinx made a bombastic reappearance in season 11. The rework of the items gave her brand new powers and now she is one of the strongest ADC champions on Summoner&#8217;s Rift. Her direct damage is often described as &#8220;unbelievable&#8221; and there aren&#8217;t too many champions that can endure her crazy rockets. So in this guide, we&#8217;ll be talking about the top 7 best supports that you can play for Jinx in season 11.</p>



<p>Similar to Kog&#8217;Maw or Ezreal, Jinx needs a support that can get her through the laning phase. She is extremely vulnerable before level 6 due to not having any mobility and no defensive spells. This type of support can either be a tank or an enchanter, with both of those categories having unique tools and playstyles.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s examine the best supports for Jinx in Season 11 and how they can work with her!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12949" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Nami is easily the enchanter <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/web-stories/top-5-best-off-meta-supports-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="web-story" data-id="12797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support with the most potential</a> in the bot lane. She can play League of Legends both aggressively and defensively and gain lots and lots of advantages throughout the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key element to understand here is Nami&#8217;s W. This isn&#8217;t only a simple healing spell, but much much more. Whenever Nami uses her W, a tidal wave bounces off her primary target to either heal an ally or damage an enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the reason why this is perfect for Jinx is that Nami can position herself to constantly poke and fend off any potential danger for Jinx. The tidal wave grants her safe trades because she can heal her health while she deals damage.</p>



<p>Other than that, Nami&#8217;s Q and Jinx&#8217;s E synergize very well too. Jinx can throw the chompers while the enemy is up in the air from Nami&#8217;s bubble for an instant root. The same can be said for their ultimates, which are both long-range abilities. A knock-up into a rocket blast is usually the best finisher move for this pair!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Blitz</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12947" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Blitz has a very dominating presence in the bot lane. His grab is one of the deadliest abilities early on in the game, especially to champions that can&#8217;t escape it. There are a couple of ways you can synergize Blitz and Jinx in the laning phase, so let&#8217;s start explaining them.</p>



<p>First, Blitz&#8217;s E is one of the best setups for Jinx&#8217;s E. Whenever Blitz knocks a champion up in the air, Jinx can throw her chompers to secure the root effect. This also works with Blitz&#8217;s Q, but Jinx has to be careful because opponents would often Flash away after being hooked by Blitz.</p>



<p>For the entire laning phase, Blitz can position himself in the frontline to scare off the enemies. He is quite tanky and he doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to use his hook. This will give enough freedom to Jinx farm and scale for the mid and late game.</p>



<p>After level 6, the kill potential of this duo doubles. Both of their ultimates do a lot of damage early on, so this is the perfect time for Jinx and Blitz to look for 2v2 skirmishes. They might not be the strongest pair in team fights, but they can <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-attack-move-orb-walk-and-kite-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="8678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kite</a> well and deal burst damage, especially if they&#8217;re the ones engaging.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Braum</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14557" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Braum is a fantastic support to have when playing Jinx. Thanks to her additional range when using her rockets, Jinx has a really easy time when trying to proc Braum&#8217;s passive. Stack her own Flame Chompers on top of that, as well as Braum&#8217;s very own Glacial Fissure when he reaches level 6, and you have a champion that has no other choice but to endure the pain coming from Jinx and her loyal muscly support.</p>



<p>Additionally, Braum has different ways of saving Jinx, most notably his E ability, Unbreakable, which blocks projectiles coming in, which can come in very handy when Jinx is trying to trade. His W grants both him and his ally bonus resistances, which are lovely to have in said trades as well.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14559" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Jinx does not have that much self-peel; she only has her chompers to rely on, which is really not optimal if she has highly mobile assassins on her tail. Thresh can compensate for this, as he has plenty of tools to stop a champion dead on their tracks. I believe we mention this in nearly every article Thresh is mentioned, but his lantern is just so good we cannot possibly overlook it, especially for a champion like Jinx.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Thresh has an amazing kill setup with his other abilities, meaning a good Thresh player will be able to Q his way into the midgame with a fed Jinx by his side, paving the way for a much more comfortable game.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14558" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Janna is great at keeping Jinx safe while she farms and scales into the mid and late game, where she shines her brightest. If and when Jinx gets to a point where she&#8217;s dealing tons of damage, the enemy team is definitely going to try an all-in to take her out, and Janna is more than prepared to deal with that.</p>



<p>Her whirlwinds and ultimate are exceptional disengage tools that can help keep even the stickiest of assassins away from your carry.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Yuumi</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14560" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This is a tricky one. We did say Jinx required a support that carried her into the mid and late game since she is one of the best scaling ADCs in the current meta. Yuumi is not exactly the type of support that can do that exceptionally well, but if this duo reaches mid-game on even terms with their opponents, they can absolutely take over a match.</p>



<p>Yuumi does provide some sustain in lane, but Jinx would have to survive being the sole focus of the enemy team, pretty much all on her own. That would leave her very open to hard engagers like Leona, Pyke, Nautilus, and others, so it would be best to play this duo into a bot lane without much early game kill pressure, like Ezreal and Senna.</p>



<h2><strong>7. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12948" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And lastly, we have Leona. This is one of the most powerful picks in the bot lane in season 11. The reason for this is because Leona has an insane amount of <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a> which works perfectly in this burst meta.</p>



<p>The playstyle of Jinx and Leona is pretty easy too. All Jinx has to do is follow up on Leona&#8217;s engages. And all Leona has to do is be as aggressive as possible. She doesn&#8217;t have shields or heals for Jinx, so she has to make up for it by being constantly in the face of their opponents and stop them from attacking. The best defense is often offense, and that&#8217;s certainly true here.</p>



<p>But the real power of the Jinx + Leona combo comes after level 6. Leona is the queen of team fights because she can control the entire enemy team with her <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>. This creates the ideal opportunity for Jinx to unleash her rockets and deal <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AoE damage</a> all around. Leona can also lock enemies in place so Jinx can throw her ultimate from afar.</p>



<p>And those are the 7 best supports for Jinx in season 11!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite Miss Fortune&#8217;s hot start in season 11, she is currently near the low end of the spectrum of ADC picks. Many arguments can be given as to why MF isn&#8217;t the strongest champion right now, but none of them can actually deny her viability. Miss Fortune has always been a solid pick, especially in matches where you have a killer wombo-combo team composition. She brings a massive <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AoE burst damage</a> to the table, so she&#8217;ll always be a good marksman to main. And in this guide, we&#8217;ll go over the best supports that you need to know when playing as or with Miss Fortune!</p>



<p>On a general note, any champion that can stun or snare the enemy is a good pick for supporting Miss Fortune. Despite her damage potential, she lacks the tools to keep her targets in place. Opponents that can constantly run away from MF are the most difficult to beat, so she needs some help in that regard.</p>



<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about the best supports for Miss Fortune in season 11 and see how you can utilize their powers!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13302" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for the absolute best combo for Miss Fortune in the bot lane, then we say go for Leona. These two champions have an insane amount of synergy and can face off against any other matchup.</p>



<p>First off, the Miss Fortune + Leona combo should be played very offensively. Leona is a natural when it comes to forcing fights and MF is great at following with bursts of damage. As soon as level 2, this pair can look for skirmishes thanks to Leona&#8217;s E and Q. However, Miss Fortune can also be the initiator if she captures an enemy with the Make It Rain ability. This will allow Leona to easily hit her skill shot on the slowed opponent.</p>



<p>But the biggest power-up of this combo comes only after level 6. With both ultimates unlocked, MF and Leona can unleash true chaos. Nothing is scarier than being caught in the center of Leona&#8217;s R while Miss Fortune is right there channeling her bullet barrage. From then on, the combo can look for fights around the map whenever they have their ultimates ready to use.</p>



<p>Leona is the easiest support partner you can pick for Miss Fortune and we highly recommend her!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Maokai</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13303" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Currently, Makoi and Miss Fortune is the combination that yields the most victories for MF. Their win rate is over 55%, which really speaks of how well this pair can do in a given matchup.</p>



<p>During the laning phase, Miss Fortune and Maokai don&#8217;t need to be aggressive at all. Maokai can keep MF safe by stuffing the bushes with his saplings and occasionally walking up to the enemies to assert dominance. Both of these champions have slow effects, which can really help them in engaging in a fight, especially Maokai.</p>



<p>Like Leona, Maokai has a killer-support ultimate for Miss Fortune. His roots cover the entire width of the lane and the river. They last for a very long time, nearly matching the channeling of MF&#8217;s Bullet Time. When combined together, this is a recipe for true disaster because Maokai ensures the entire damage of Miss Fortune&#8217;s ultimate, which we all know is totally broken.</p>



<p>So don&#8217;t hesitate to try some Maokai + Miss Fortune action!</p>

<h2><strong>3. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="653" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-1024x653.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13304" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-1024x653.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-300x191.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-768x490.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-150x96.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-750x479.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-1140x727.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami.jpg 1332w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Nami can be your backup plan when choosing a support for Miss Fortune in case you get tired of tanks. She provides quite a lot of benefit to the matchup, but most importantly &#8211; healing. The duo sits at over 53% win rate, which is more than most other<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> duos in League of Legends</a>.</p>



<p>Ebb and Flow, Nami&#8217;s W, is a fantastic ability to have during the laning phase. It&#8217;s both a poking and a healing tool and experienced Nami players always try to achieve both effects when using it. And since Miss Fortune doesn&#8217;t always build lifesteal, this is a pretty handy thing to have.</p>



<p>Similar to Leona, MF can use her E to slow down their enemies so Nami can secure her knock-up. This will create a small chain of <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> which the duo can use to deal damage. Nami&#8217;s E is another incredibly useful spell and can be used to power up Miss Fortune&#8217;s Qs.</p>



<p>Once the ultimates are ready, you can synergize them to keep enemies knocked up and slowed for the entire duration of Bullet Time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And those are the top 3 best supports for Miss Fortune in season 11 of League of Legends!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Varus&#8217;s popularity spiked a lot in season 11 of League of Legends. A couple of buffs to his damage combined with the mythic item changes opened a way for this marksman to shine on the Rift. Currently, there are two different build paths for Varus. One focuses on his on-hit damage and attack speed. And the other build favors <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/lethality-league-of-legends-how-does-it-work-updated/" data-type="post" data-id="7321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lethality</a> items and funnels all the power in Varus&#8217;s Q. But whatever is your preference, you still need to know which supports are the best for Varus in season 11!</p>



<p>Varus has a very specific playstyle in League, one that only a few other marksmen have. He requires a certain type of support that can enhance his ability to carry. Generally, the support champions that best suit Varus offers a lot of crowd control effects. But there are some that excel in this, way more than the others.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s check them out!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Morgana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13088" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Whenever players see Morgana + Varus in the bot lane, they&#8217;re usually terrified. This <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bot lane combo</a> is simply overloaded with damage right from the start of the game.</p>



<p>Level 1 as Varus and Morgana should be aggressive. This means that you can always go for an invade or a sneaky snare from the brush. The combined power of Morgana&#8217;s root and Varus&#8217;s arrow is enough to secure a kill in the early game. And experienced players try to take advantage of it.</p>



<p>But Morgana comes with another benefit for Varus &#8211; her spell shield. Varus doesn&#8217;t have any mobility and no defensive abilities either. His build is always offensive, so having a spell shield to keep him out of trouble is almost mandatory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After level 6, Varus and Morgana have a way easier time dealing with their opponents. Varus&#8217;s R travels faster than Morgana&#8217;s Q, so he can always take the first turn in snaring their opponent. Morgana can follow this either with Q or her ultimate to lock the target down. This makes it easy for Varus to hit his empowered arrow and get the kills.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13087" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Leona has a very defined playstyle in the bot lane &#8211; <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a> and tanking. And it&#8217;s quite obvious why she perfectly fits Varus and how he usually plays the laning phase.</p>



<p>Leona provides a long duration of crowd control, which Varus desperately needs for successfully landing his Q. But the advantage of Leona over other supports is that she doesn&#8217;t rely on her ultimate to do this. Both of her Q and E abilities can hold a target down as soon as level 2. This opens fantastic opportunities for early kills in the lane.</p>



<p>The kill potential of Varus and Leona doubles when they unlock their ultimates. Combined, they can chain <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> a target for over 5 seconds, which is more than enough to kill anyone in the game</p>



<p>On the other hand, Leona is extremely good at kiting in team fights. She can stop multiple enemy champions as they try to attack Varus. And since Varus doesn&#8217;t often build defensive items, this is very welcomed.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Zyra</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13089" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Zyra plays a similar role to Morgana when she is paired with Varus. However, Zyra offers a lot more damage than Morgana throughout the game and it&#8217;s usually considered the very best among the supports for Varus in season 11.</p>



<p>One of the biggest advantages that Zyra has over Morgana is the fact that her root travels through minions. This makes it way easier to land the ability, which in turn lets Varus secure his arrow. After level 6, Varus can enhance Zyra&#8217;s damage by locking people in place so Zyra can damage them with her ultimate. But this works the other way around as well.</p>



<p>Many players in the lower elos underestimate the power of Zyra&#8217;s plants. But experienced players will always think twice about engaging Varus or Zyra when these plants are up. In short, they do massive amounts of damage to champions, especially in the laning phase. So make sure to spawn Zyra&#8217;s plants whenever the enemies are preparing to engage. They can sometimes turn the tide of the battle in your favor.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14044" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Varus goes really well with Nami’s kit, regardless of what build path he chooses for the match. Her E is sort of a double buff, where the bonus damage goes nicely with on-hit Varus, and the slow is of course a very welcome addition, especially for lethality Varus, helping him find his target more often.</p>



<p>Nami does also bring a hefty amount of sustain to the lane, which Varus really lacks. This helps him stay longer in lane to farm and trade. Also, Nami provides a nice movement speed bonus with her passive, meaning Varus will have an easier time dodging abilities and positioning well to deal damage.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Yuumi</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14045" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>When talking about sustain, we cannot leave Yuumi out of the picture. Bringing both healing and shielding into the game, she does an excellent job at keeping her carry healthy. This does, however, come at the cost of redirecting the grand majority of focus onto Varus in this case, since she does become untargetable when attached, so the enemy will only be able to target Varus when coming in for a poke.</p>



<p>Yuumi does also amp Varus’ damaging stats thanks to the passive portion of her W ability, further increasing Varus’ damage output in general. Last but definitely not least is the crowd control chain that these two can set up. Three hits from Yuumi’s ultimate root the target long enough for Varus to hit a free ult, locking the target down for a considerable amount of time.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14043" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Similar to various supports in this list, Lulu has an on-hit bonus that helps Varus immensely. She has an attack speed steroid which also serves as a small damage amplifier. Shields for sustain and her ever-annoying polymorph ability to abruptly shut down any dive onto Varus.</p>



<p>Her ultimate, Wild Growth, is a sort of lifeline ability that would allow either her or Varus to survive very sticky situations with its bonus health on cast. Lulu by herself is really one of the most annoying supports in Season 11, but paired with an ADC she synergizes well with, and you have a recipe for a dreadful laning phase for the opposition.</p>

<h2><strong>7. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14042" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This partnership is one of the best for Varus. Janna is capable of keeping Varus safe thanks to her many tools to break an engage. Whirlwinds are useful for setups or escapes, and her ultimate can halt even the most daring assault, giving her allies some much-needed space between them and the enemies, as well as a generous amount of healing.</p>



<p>Janna also boasts an AD steroid that Varus can make great use of, especially with his range. All in all, this is an excellent duo to have down in the bottom lane.</p>



<p>And those are the top 7 best supports for Varus in season 11 of League of Legends!</p>

<p>Draven is one of the few marksmen that wasn&#8217;t majorly affected by the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/riot-reveals-new-mythic-items-and-item-shop-changes-for-the-next-season/" data-type="post" data-id="8954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mythic item changes</a> in season 11. His overall dominating laning phase got a bit enhanced and now he is one of the<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-hyper-carries/" data-type="post" data-id="9744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> strongest champions to carry games</a> with. But Draven isn&#8217;t a self-sufficient champion and he lacks many important elements, such as mobility and defensiveness. And that&#8217;s where the best supports for Draven come into play!</p>



<p>Draven should be and often is the bully in the bot lane. He prefers supports that are either hyper-aggressive or champions that can protect him while he&#8217;s being aggressive. But there are clear winners in both of these categories, so let&#8217;s talk about the top 7 best supports for Draven in season 11 of League of Legends!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-13137" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Thresh is one of the most popular supports in League of Legends. But he is also one of the best champions to play in combination with Draven. Almost all of the tools that Thresh brings to the table can in some way enhance Draven&#8217;s performance. So let&#8217;s examine them.</p>



<p>One of the most notable things about Thresh is his <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a>. His long-range Q can catch enemies off guard and help Thresh bounce them back with E or slow them down with R. This allows Draven to continually hit their opponents until they die. One of the biggest weaknesses of Draven is the inability to <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> targets, so Thresh solves that in a way.</p>



<p>But Thresh has one more key thing &#8211; his lantern. This is one of the best mobility spells that a support champion can offer to his allies. The lantern helps Draven escape sticky situations or quickly reach his targets. These two champions can play very aggressively as long as the Thresh player is experienced in landing hooks and throwing lanterns in the right spots.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Blitzcrank</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="538" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-1024x538.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-13135" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-300x158.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-768x403.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-150x79.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-750x394.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-1140x599.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Blitzcrank and Draven have a very similar playstyle to Thresh and Draven. But Blitzcrank is a much simpler champion than his support rival so the combo between him and Draven is way easier to execute.</p>



<p>For example, the easiest way to get a kill as Blitzcrank and Draven is to pull someone towards you with Q and knock him up with E. This is enough crowd control for any stage of the game, simply because of how much damage Draven can do. And you can repeat this process throughout the match.</p>



<p>Many players agree that Blitz has an advantage over Thresh when supporting Draven because his Q displaces the target, rather than locking him into place. Any champion that can bring squishy targets to Draven and hold them down is a good support, but Blitz simply excels at it.</p>



<p>And let&#8217;s not forget Blitzcrank&#8217;s ultimate. His silence is another form of CC because it also stops champions from using Flash too. All in all, Blitz is one of the best supports to choose whenever you see Draven locked in a solo queue.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-13136" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Nami isn&#8217;t anywhere near to Thresh or Blitz in terms of playstyle, but she can aid Draven in different ways. Remember, Draven can also be paired with supportive champions, such as Soraka, Janna, or Lulu. But Nami is simply the best for supporting him in particular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important thing that Nami brings to this combo is her heal. This is both a defensive and an offensive ability since the healing wave bounces off both allies and enemies. Experienced Nami players will always look to damage enemies while healing their allies. And since Draven doesn&#8217;t have any poke damage except his auto-attacks, this is great for trading early on in lane.</p>



<p>But Nami also offers two different knock-up effects. Both her Q and R have considerably long range and can be used for either engaging or disengaging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the last thing that not too many players abuse as Nami is her E ability. Whenever used, this spell enhances the next 3 attacks of herself or her chosen allies. These 3 attacks deal bonus damage, but also apply a slow effect on the enemy for 1 second. You can clearly see why this is a huge benefit for Draven in any type of scenario.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Leona</strong></h2>

<p>When talking about locking down an enemy in place, few can do it as well as Leona. Her E Q combo is quite lengthy. Add in her ultimate after reaching level 6 and your target will not stand a chance, Draven will have too much freedom to deal absurd amounts of damage to a target that will not even be able to trade back.</p>



<p>A really good added bonus is that Leona is inherently very tanky thanks to her W. There&#8217;s almost no way the enemy can hope to burst her down, and given her Q has a relatively low cooldown, extended trades would be heavily beneficial for the Draven and Leona duo.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Soraka</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14039" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Draven likes being aggressive, but he doesn’t have the biggest of ranges, meaning he often finds himself getting slapped back when he goes in to poke a bit. Soraka will help mitigate any sort of damage Draven receives in such trades.</p>



<p>Another sweet trading tool Soraka brings to the table is her silence. This will block enemy champions from using any abilities, meaning hard engage supports such as Pyke or even Pantheon will not be able to jump on top of either laner as long as they are inside the abilities area of effect.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Pyke</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14038" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Well, we did just say he was a hard engaging support right? Draven loves this type of company, as it helps him get into fights more often. Pyke is sort of a more aggressive, damage-heavy hooking support, so while he does not really have much utility such as Thresh’s lantern, for example, Pyke does excel at dealing damage and bursting down squishies.</p>



<p>His ultimate is fantastic as well, it is an execute that gives the full amount of kill gold to whoever was the most recent ally to damage the enemy and get the assist. This gets even better because this stacks with Draven’s passive. You read that right, should an enemy die to this duo, Pyke’s R will grant Draven the full amount of gold from the kill, and Draven himself will have his passive triggered, making this duo a phenomenal gold snowball.</p>



<h2><strong>7. Nautilus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14037" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>I guess we can summarize and say Draven quite enjoys a support that has a hook. Similar to the hooking supports above, Nautilus has good engage potential and can lock a target down for Draven to fling axes at the target.</p>



<p>His point and click ult serves as a fantastic initiation tool, especially if Nautilus is able to follow up with his Q and passive root. As a natural tank, Nautilus is able to soak up a lot of retaliation damage for Draven.</p>



<p>And those are the top 7 best supports for Draven in season 11 of League of Legends! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Vayne is a very unique ADC champion in League of Legends. Not only is she able to 1v9 games, but she&#8217;s also a difficult champion to master. Vayne doesn&#8217;t have any <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AoE ability</a>, and her playstyle mostly revolves around kiting the enemy with her tumbles. And although she&#8217;s powerful on her own, she does extremely well with a few supports in particular. So, who are the best supports for Vayne?</p>



<p>With so many champions able to fill the support role, it&#8217;s difficult to find the perfect one for Vayne. Yes, she typically requires a &#8220;supportive&#8221; support, someone who can get her through the laning phase, but that&#8217;s not always the case.</p>



<p><strong>Generally, Vayne works best with enchanter supports such as Lulu, Soraka, and Yuumi, but she can also do really well with tank supports because they can <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-peel-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peel</a> for her. And so, here I&#8217;ve chosen the top 5 best supports for Vayne in League of Legends. All of these champions have a great level of synergy with Vayne&#8217;s kit, so they&#8217;re always a good choice. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Take a look!</strong></p>



<h2><strong>1. Taric</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12992" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Taric</strong> may not be the most popular champion in League of Legends, but he&#8217;s damn good at supporting late game ADCs. Naturally, Vayne falls in this category, so this makes her and Taric a perfect pair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In season 11, Vayne has the best win rate with Taric. It circles around 56-57%, which is one of the highest numbers you can find among the bot lane synergies. In other words, Vayne and Taric win way more than they lose in all servers and elos of League of Legends.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why is this the case?</em></strong></p>



<p>Well, Taric has a few tools that turn Vayne into a monster marksman. For starters, Taric&#8217;s heal and bonus armor allow Vayne to safely farm in the laning phase. And thanks to it, she can quickly scale and reach her power spikes.</p>



<p>Additionally, Taric has a great stun mechanic. It can be used as a counterplay in situations where enemies jump on Vayne. It will allow Vayne to get away or gain enough range to start hitting back.</p>



<p>But Taric&#8217;s ultimate is what makes the biggest difference here. His Cosmic Radiance is one of the best abilities in the entire game. It turns Vayne invulnerable, allowing her to damage their opponents without losing HP. This is incredibly helpful in all situations, especially in games against assassins or fighters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, when should you play the Taric and Vayne combo. Honestly, any matchup is good as long as you aren&#8217;t particularly aggressive in the early game. Taric doesn&#8217;t have too much damage, and Vayne&#8217;s power depends on levels and gold. So, it&#8217;s best to take it slowly and farm for the late game.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Soraka</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12991" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Soraka</strong> has a similar function when it comes to supporting Vayne. And the biggest reason why she and Vayne have such a high win rate together (around 56%) is that Soraka can keep Vayne alive all the way to the late game.</p>



<p>In other words, Soraka&#8217;s best asset is her heal. She&#8217;s able to continually top Vayne&#8217;s health in lane, making it almost impossible for their opponents to slay them. This is particularly handy in those aggressive matchups, such as Caitlyn, Brand, Leona, and Draven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Soraka isn&#8217;t just a heal bot in LoL. You can often see experienced players completely outplay their enemies on the champion. Soraka can silence champions and put them into a root. But she can also damage them and slow them down. All of these tools go well with Vayne&#8217;s playstyle, so you have to apply them too.</p>



<p>In team fights, the power of Soraka and Vayne is almost unmatched. This is because Soraka has nearly unlimited healing to support Vayne with. And unless you&#8217;re playing a very bursty assassin, you can&#8217;t really slay Vayne when Soraka is healing her.</p>



<p>Their endurance is further backed up by Soraka&#8217;s ultimate, Wish. This ability is an AoE heal that can single-handedly win a team fight. If used right after Soraka&#8217;s W, Astral Infusion, it can regain 60-70% of Vayne&#8217;s lost health.</p>



<p>And the best part about it is that Grevious Wounds no longer works against Wish. Soraka&#8217;s R heals the target no matter the Grevious Wound percentage. And this means that as long as Soraka has her ultimate ready, Vayne simply can&#8217;t die.</p>



<p>So, that&#8217;s why Soraka is one of the best supports for Vayne in League of Legends.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Yuumi</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12993" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Although <strong>Yuumi</strong> is a ridiculous champion, she&#8217;s also one of the most broken ones. Not too many champions can stay untargetable during the entire fight and still influence it in their favor. So, she and Vayne are a great pair when it comes to team fighting.</p>



<p>When you analyze Yuumi as a champion, you can see that she doesn&#8217;t go well with any champion either. But if her bot laner is weak, she can choose to attach herself to a carry ally. However, in this case, she doesn&#8217;t have to. Vayne is one of the strongest carries in League of Legends, no matter the sore.</p>



<p>Yuumi can tilt players out of their minds simply by keeping her attached ally alive. It&#8217;s insane when you think about how much value she brings to the table while being nearly invincible.</p>



<p>While attached to Vayne, Yuumi can use her ability to kit to slow their enemies down, so Vayne can chase them. She can also root their opponents, making it easier for Vayne to take them down. But most importantly, Yuumi can keep Vayne alive with her heal.</p>



<p>Yuumi&#8217;s E, Zoomies, is one of the<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-healers-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="10495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> most potent heals </a>in the game. It rivals Soraka&#8217;s heal, despite being a single ability. And it&#8217;s incredibly useful to Vayne, especially in the early game.</p>



<p>And the thing that many players forget about Yuumi is the fact that she grants up to 20% AD or AP to the champion she&#8217;s attached. For Vayne, this is very helpful because it amplifies her damage significantly in the late game. And that&#8217;s why her DPS is the highest when paired with Yuumi.</p>

<h2><strong>4. Zyra</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12994" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Zyra</strong> doesn&#8217;t have a heal, a shield, or invulnerability for Vayne. But, she has damage! And a lot of it! Seriously, Zyra is one of the most broken supports in the game and one of the best ones for Vayne.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can&#8217;t often see an exceptional Zyra player in solo queue, but believe me, there are. And when you&#8217;re matched against that kind of a Zyra player, plus a Vayne next to her, it&#8217;s all pain and sadness. Why?</p>



<p>Well, Zyra is a highly aggressive champion in lane. Her abilities are designed in such a way that she can always apply her damage, no matter whether there are minions in the lane or not.</p>



<p><strong><em>What do I mean by this?</em></strong></p>



<p>For example, Zyra&#8217;s E, Grasping Roots, travels through minions and damages every target it hits, no matter the number. Similarly, Zyra&#8217;s Q, Deadly Spines, also damages all enemies in a line for the same amount. This makes it easy for her to poke Vayne&#8217;s opponent and keep them away from her.</p>



<p>One thing that experienced Zyra players also take advantage of is her plants. You can use Zyra&#8217;s plants to block skill shots or torment the enemy ADC when he&#8217;s trying to farm. This alone can win you the lane, so make sure to constantly apply them.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Vayne has a different playstyle when she&#8217;s around Zyra. Although she can engage in a fight from time to time, it&#8217;s often the Zyra player who creates all the kill opportunities for Vayne. It is actually the opposite when playing Vayne with Taric, Soraka, and Yuumi, but it&#8217;s very interesting too.</p>



<p>So, Zyra is one of the best supports for Vayne in League of Legends, without a doubt!</p>



<h2><strong>5. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12990" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>&nbsp;Janna is one of the most versatile support champions in League of Legends. And you can always pick her to try and enable your teammates to carry you to victory. But this is especially true if you have Vayne in your team.</p>



<p>The way Janna and Vayne play the laning phase is very simple. Vayne usually focuses on farming while Janna is there to either poke or protect Vayne while she&#8217;s collecting gold. There aren&#8217;t usually too many 2v2 opportunities that these two champions can take, but they can certainly get a double kill if they outplay their opponents.</p>



<p>Once the laning phase is over, Vayne and Janna can show their true power. During the mid-game, Vayne becomes a monster. And with Janna by her side, Vayne can indefinitely kite and deal damage to anyone in range. On top of a low-cooldown shield, Janna has two knock-up effects and a slow. This is more than enough to keep Vayne safe from all kinds of trouble.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Brand</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12989" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And finally, we have <strong>Brand</strong>! Brand&#8217;s role in the bot lane is similar to that of Zyra&#8217;s, but it also has differences. He and Vayne have a high win rate of 53%, which is great, considering the fact that Brand can&#8217;t support Vayne in the traditional way.</p>



<p>Now, Brand&#8217;s damage isn&#8217;t as good as Zyra in the early game. However, he has a stun instead of root, which is usually more effective in the 2v2 fights. And if Brand stuns an enemy near a wall, Vayne can use this opportunity to stun that enemy as well.</p>



<p>As the game progresses, Brand&#8217;s damage becomes almost unbearable. In my opinion, his passive is totally broken, especially in the late game. This helps Vayne shred tanks even quicker, so it&#8217;s a great bonus to her damage too.</p>



<p>During the laning phase, Brand is the one that dictates the tempo. Vayne can safely farm if Brand is chasing her opponents away with his W, but that isn&#8217;t always the case. Brand is a short-ranged champion himself, so it does take knowledge and skill to make this combo work.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t win with this duo. In fact, I would say that it is one of the easiest <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bot lane combos</a> to play after the 15th minute. Vayne can kite enemies all day long. And Brand only needs to activate his ultimate to spread his passive.</p>



<p>All in all, Brand is one of the best supports for Vayne if played correctly. He provides damage and peeling, two things that not all support champions can provide at the same time. So definitely this duo out!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>And those are the top 3 best supports for Vayne in season 11 of League of Legends!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the beginning of season 11, Jhin has been a heavily contested pick in the bot lane. Everybody knows that the current meta revolves around burst damage, so Jhin naturally fits this playstyle. His four critical shots can deal massive damage with only a few items and he isn&#8217;t as dependent as many other marksmen champions. However, you still need to know which are the best supports for Jhin in season 11 of League of Legends.</p>



<p>Because Jhin is so unique in the way he plays the bot lane, different support champions can aid him differently. Generally, Jhin goes well with any enchanter he can find, but his favorites are the poke mages. You typically want to avoid tanks such as Alistar or Leona, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t make the combo work. In any case, here are the top 3 best supports for Jhin in season 11!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Brand</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12870" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Brand is often considered the best among the supports for Jhin. There are many arguments to back up this statement, but let&#8217;s examine the most important of them.</p>



<p>If Jhin and Brand can be characterized by one thing, then that is massive damage. Brand is a highly aggressive laner in general, and he is usually always in the front casting spells. This benefits Jhin a lot since he can rely on Brand to poke and set up his root. And many forget that Brand&#8217;s burning passive prolongs the mark of Jhin&#8217;s W, so he has more time to fire off this ability and snare someone.</p>



<p>Obviously, whenever Brand stuns an enemy champion with his E+Q combo, he and Jhin can unleash heavy damage and secure a kill in most cases. However, Jhin can also set up Brand&#8217;s damage by lying his traps around the lane. Once their enemies are slowed, Brand can easily land his stun.</p>



<p>After level 6, this combo is better with Brand in the front and Jhin in the back. Jhin&#8217;s ultimate can serve both as a finisher after Brand&#8217;s R or as an opener. In any way, the synergy between these champions is high and you need to take advantage of it!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Morgana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12872" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The second support champion that we want to discuss here is Morgana. She might not have the same damage as Brand, but she has other tools such as her spell shield. This ability is very influential in the bot lane because it opens more opportunities than any other form of shielding or healing.</p>



<p>Truthfully, Jhin is a very squishy champion and doesn&#8217;t have any form of mobility (except maybe Galeforce) to escape his opponents. Well, Morgana&#8217;s Black Shield is a cure for all marksmen similar to Jhin because it negates the enemy <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> and oftentimes damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another bonus that Jhin receives by being paired with Morgana is the easy W setup. Morgana doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to hit her Q so Jhin can follow it with his Deadly Flourish. She only needs to put down her W ability for at least one tick and mark the enemy champion. This is very useful, especially in situations when the opponents are running away.</p>



<p>Obviously, level 6 is a big power spike for both of these champions. Morgana&#8217;s stun can be used to lock targets in place while Jhin&#8217;s R can be a finisher. All in all, Morgana is one of the best supports that you can play with Jhin in all matchups.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12873" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And lastly, we have Nami. With the recent changes to Nami&#8217;s E, she became the go-to support for any mage in the bot lane or any marksmen in the style of Ezreal or Jhin. The reason for this is that Nami&#8217;s E now provides both attack damage and ability power, depending on whether her ally will use basic attacks or spells. This is obviously great for Jhin since he relies on his abilities as much as his attacks, especially his ultimate.</p>



<p>Nami has another very interesting mechanic in the bot lane &#8211; her heal. This ability jumps between enemies and allies, so it causes both damage and healing. The way this ability can benefit Jhin is very simple &#8211; he can position himself aggressively so the wave bounces between him and his opponent. Once the enemy is hit, Jhin can follow this up with a snare and Nami with a bubble.</p>



<p>Both ultimates here a considerably long range and can be synergized. The knock-up effect from Nami&#8217;s R can allow Jhin to land all of his skill shots and secure the kills!</p>



<h2><strong>4. Blitzcrank</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12957" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Blitzcrank</strong> is a great champion to play in combination with Jhin. He has a few exceptional strengths when it comes to the laning phase, which also benefits Jhin.</p>



<p>For starters, Blitzcrank&#8217;s Q, Rocket Grab, is one of the most feared abilities in the entire game. Blitz can use it to bring an enemy next to him and set up a kill for Jhin. Blitzcrank usually casts E immediately after his Q, which also knocks up the enemy.</p>



<p>Well, Jhin can use his W during this time to extended the CC time here. But he can also throw his own E under the knocked-up target, so it may detonate faster. Both champions can coordinate these abilities and lock one target down for a couple of seconds.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Jhin&#8217;s root opens up a fantastic opportunity for Blitz to use his Q. The same can be said for Jhin&#8217;s ultimate, but his root is just the best way for Blitz to grab someone. Both Jhin and Blitz have fantastic damage throughout the game, so they go very well together.</p>



<p>Having Blitzcrank in your team is always beneficial, not just for Jhin. One well-aimed grab in the late game often means an ace, baron, or even victory. Jhin can match this playstyle fantastically, so that&#8217;s why Blitz is one of the best supports for him!</p>



<h2><strong>5. Zyra</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12960" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And <strong>Zyra</strong> is among the best mage supports for Jhin too. Actually, she can even be the very best choice for Jhin in the bot lane, but not everybody knows how to play her. She isn&#8217;t a popular champion, so her playstyle may be a bit weird to some people.</p>



<p>To get an idea, you have to be aggressive as Zyra. Now, this doesn&#8217;t mean that you should blindly engage all the time. But it means that you need to poke and bully your enemies without getting damaged as much in return.</p>



<p>How can you do this effectively?</p>



<p>For example, you can cast your E, Grasping Thorns through the enemy minions while standing behind your own minions. This will snare and damage your enemies while and you&#8217;ll be safe from incoming skill shots. You can use Zyra&#8217;s Q in a similar way. This is very helpful because Zyra is a short-ranged squishy champion.</p>



<p>And how does this help Jhin?</p>



<p>Well, Jhin has a lot of damage, but he is even more squishy than Zyra. He needs a support that will start the fight and draw all the attention. He can follow up Zyra&#8217;s snare with his W or use his ultimate to take their opponents down.</p>



<p>Another way to synergize these two champions is with Zyra&#8217;s plants. You see, any time one of Zyra&#8217;s plants attacks a champion, it also triggers the mark from Jhin&#8217;s W. This is probably the easiest way to apply this ability, so make sure to take advantage of that.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Vel&#8217;Koz</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12959" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Vel&#8217;koz</strong> is another mage that goes incredibly well with Jhin. Not only does he have a lot of damage, but he is also great at setting up crowd control with Jhin. Vel&#8217;Koz has a bigger range than Morgana, so it&#8217;s also a safer option for supporting Jhin.</p>



<p>The Vel&#8217;Koz and Jhin lane usually goes aggressively. Vel&#8217;Koz has a lot of mana early on, and his abilities don&#8217;t cost as much. He can literally spam spells all day long and scare enemies away from Jhin. This works with all of his abilities, especially his Q, Plasma Fission.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Jhin can use Vel&#8217;Koz&#8217;s poke to either snare enemies or chase them down for a kill. It&#8217;s actually pretty easy to finish off targets once they&#8217;ve been chunked down by a purple octopus monster…</p>



<p>But in all seriousness, Vel&#8217;Koz&#8217;s damage is honestly broken. A big reason for that is his passive, which allows him to deal true damage to his targets. Combined with the high burst that Jhin has, this combo is one of the deadliest on the Rift.</p>



<p>After level 6, Jhin and Vel&#8217;Koz are amazing at 2v2 fights. Both champions can poke effectively and then activate their ultimates to take down their enemies from range. This also works in 5v5 team fights, so their damage is always reliable.</p>



<h2><strong>7. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12958" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And lastly, we have <strong>Janna</strong>. Janna isn&#8217;t an aggressive mage, nor is she able to tank enemies for Jhin. However, she is exceptionally good at setting up kills for Jhin and protecting him from their opponents.</p>



<p>One of the best synergies that Janna and Jhin have is combining Janna&#8217;s tornado with Jhin&#8217;s root. For example, Janna can cast her Q, Howling Gale, from a very long distance. And if it hits a target, Jhin can also apply his W, Deadly Flourish, while the target is still in the air. This guarantees a root effect, so it&#8217;s good to do it whenever you can.</p>



<p>But the biggest value that Janna brings to this combo lies elsewhere. You see, all other best supports we mentioned for Jhin were good at dealing damage. But Janna is good at eliminating the damage from their enemies.</p>



<p>Janna&#8217;s E is probably the best shied in the entire game. It is on an incredibly low cooldown, allowing Janna to practically spam it. This makes her laning phase with Jhin a breeze since she can always protect him from poke damage and all-ins.</p>



<p>But Janna&#8217;s ultimate is also a handy ability for Jhin. It heals for a significant amount, especially if Janna has a bit of AP. It can also be used to push back enemies that are engaging on Jhin, which is why it&#8217;s an effective tool against assassins too.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>So there you have it, those are the top 7 best supports for Jhin in League of Legends!</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Truthfully, Kog&#8217;Maw has seen better days than season 11. His immobile tool kit is too vulnerable in today&#8217;s meta, where the burst damage is significantly higher than any other season of League of Legends. As a result, Kog&#8217;Maw requires specific supports that can make him viable and set him up for carrying. So in today&#8217;s guide, we&#8217;ll go over the top 3 supports that best suit Kog&#8217;Maw in season 11!</p>



<p>Typically, you want to pair Kog&#8217;Maw with a champion that can protect him. Although tanks can be pretty useful in team fights, they lack the necessary tools to push Kog&#8217;Maw through the laning phase. He&#8217;s got quite a short-range (before level 6) and doesn&#8217;t have any way of escaping CC other than side-stepping.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s talk about the 3 best supports for Kog&#8217;Maw and how to play them!</p>

<h2><strong>1. Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13487" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Since the dawn of time, Lulu and Kog&#8217;Maw have been one of the<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> most feared duos in League of Legends</a>. These two champions have an insane amount of synergy and work perfectly together, almost as if they&#8217;re were created for each other.</p>



<p>The first thing to understand here is how Lulu&#8217;s passive works. Whenever Lulu shields or speeds up an ally, her fae companion Pix will stick around the ally to deal bonus damage on each auto-attack. This mechanic is useful for all champions in the game, but with Kog&#8217;Maw it reaches new heights.</p>



<p>Kog&#8217;s W extends the range of his basic attacks and empowers them to deal bonus max health damage. On top of the additional damage from Pix, these auto-attacks can melt everyone, including tanks. Kog&#8217;Maw&#8217;s build in season 11 is packed with a lot of attack speed, so he doubles the value of these benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all because Lulu also solves every other problem that Kog has a champion. Kog&#8217;Maw has no mobility &#8211; Lulu grants him movement speed; Kog&#8217;Maw is very squishy &#8211; Lulu gives him a shield; Kog&#8217;Maw can&#8217;t block <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> &#8211; Lulu can knock everyone away from him. And that&#8217;s what makes her the best among the supports for Kog&#8217;Maw in season 11!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Morgana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13488" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Morgana is partly aggressive and partly defensive support. What makes her truly terrifying is the abundance of crowd control and the ability to block the enemy spells. The latter is one of the most useful effects in the entire League of Legends, so Morgana is always among the best supports for Kog&#8217;Maw too.</p>



<p>Making Kog immune to CC while he spits powerful attacks that shred the enemy frontline is perhaps the strongest move you can do in LoL. Morgana frees Kog&#8217;Maw to move around the map and engage in team fights. But Morgana can also engage first and open the way for Kog&#8217;s heavy artillery.</p>



<p>Another thing that should be noted here is how well Morgana&#8217;s Q and R synergize with Kog&#8217;Maw&#8217;s skill shots, especially his R. Many ADC players underestimate the damage of Kog&#8217;s ultimate, mainly because it deals magic damage and not physical. But both the base damage and the AP ratio of this ability are seriously insane and Kog can kill anyone with it as long as he has mana.</p>



<p>In the bot lane, Morgana and Kog&#8217;Maw can play aggressively into almost any matchup, as long as Morgana makes good use of her snare and spell shield.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13486" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Janna and Kog&#8217;Maw is a very typical bot lane duo. You generally want to play this matchup as carefully as possible in the first few levels. Kog&#8217;s damage is considerably low in the early game and Janna has only one damaging ability &#8211; her W.</p>



<p>After level 6, this pair becomes more durable. Thanks to his ultimate, Kog can unleash a tremendous amount of damage as long as he is careful about his mana. And Janna has multiple ways of protecting Kog&#8217;Maw. Her shield has a very short cooldown and her ultimate is her reliable plan B.</p>



<p>But in the mid and late game, Kog&#8217;Maw and Janna are even more powerful. All Janna needs to do is to run around Kog&#8217;Maw and spam her shield. And all Kog has to do is deal damage from afar and be careful of the enemy assassins. It&#8217;s easier said than done, but that&#8217;s the principal idea of playing team fights with this duo.</p>



<p>And those are the 3 best supports for Kog&#8217;Maw in season 11!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Everybody knows that Kalista is currently not as strong as she was in some of the previous seasons of League of Legends. Her kit is designed around peeling, kiting, and dealing damage over long periods of time. She lacks instant burst damage and survivability, two of the most important elements of the current meta. And although Kalista can be a solid ADC pick in LoL, you must know which support champions can increase her chance of winning. So today we&#8217;ll go over the 7 best supports for Kalista in season 11!</p>



<p>The most important part of synergizing Kalista with another champion has always been her ultimate. Thanks to this ability, Kalista can bind herself to an ally. And once she has an Oathsworn, she can pull that ally to herself and let them launch forward for a surprising knock-up effect. This creates a complicated web of opportunities for many champions to take advantage of, so Kalista has no shortage of support candidates.</p>



<p>But let&#8217;s talk about the top 7 supports for Kalista in season 11 and explain why they&#8217;re the best choices!</p>

<h2><strong>1. Braum</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="538" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-1024x538.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12698" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-300x158.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-768x403.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-150x79.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-750x394.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum-1140x599.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-braum.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever played Kalista in League of Legends then you know that the best kind of support is the one that benefits from being thrown in the middle of the action. Braum is such a candidate, having an enormous potential to flip the team fight on its head.</p>



<p>Braum brings a couple of benefits to Kalista&#8217;s playstyle. He is an extremely defensive champion and can protect Kalista while she focuses on farming in the early game. But Braum can also engage and, thanks to his passive, provide a stun effect which Kalista can use to secure kills early on.</p>



<p>In team fights, Kalista and Braum can always engage first to create an advantage. By knocking the enemy team up Braum opens an opportunity for himself to use his ultimate. This also allows Kalista to deal a massive amount of damage while all her enemies are crowd controlled.</p>



<p>Obviously, Kalista can also use her ultimate to get Braum out of trouble in case he&#8217;s way too deep in the enemy territory. Then Braum can follow this with his own ultimate, which is also a great tool for disengage.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Alistar</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12697" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-alistar.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>If Braum isn&#8217;t your type of champion or you&#8217;ve never played him, then Alistar should your second choice when considering supports for Kalista in season 11. Alistar is simply amazing in a combo with Kalista, adding one more knock-up and incredible protection for the AD carry.</p>



<p>Similar to Braum, Kalista can always throw Alistar in the middle of the fight and get great results. Alistar doesn&#8217;t have the biggest range in LoL and he often needs a little push forward. What&#8217;s great about these two champions is that not only they can keep enemies in the air for a long time, but they can also push someone away from their team. Alistar&#8217;s W is a great tool for isolating targets, especially the carries.</p>



<p>In the lane, Alistar can defend Kalista from most attackers either by pushing enemies away or passively healing her. He can position himself offensively so the opponents would have to eliminate him first and Kalista second.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14678" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Leona is a tanky aggressive support. Kalista likes this playstyle because it goes well with her. When Leona locks down a target, Kalista can stack her spears into the target, and well, there are options once you reach a certain point. Kalista can leave the trades short and bursty, meaning rinse and repeat until you push your opponent out of lane, opening you up to farm calmly and possibly take tower plates in the early game, or go for an all-in looking for the kill.</p>



<p>Leona is very tanky thanks to her W, meaning she can withstand some damage without losing too much health. This is heavily beneficial in short trades, as it will be tough for the opposing duo to do any significant damage to her.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Pantheon</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14679" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-pantheon.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Kalista has a passive effect which deals bonus magic damage whenever she and her Oathsworn attack the same target within 4 seconds. Pantheon has a straightforward way to proc this by using his W, a gap closer and stun. Kalista can then follow up with her own damage to burst a target down and force a recall at the very least.</p>



<p>Pantheon is an excellent pick for Kalista since he has a reasonably strong early game, enabling him to carry through it and allow Kalista to scale by farming and buying her own items. Pantheon’s in-your-face playstyle synergized very well with Kalista.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Galio</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14677" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supp-for-kalista-galio.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Galio has quite an aggressive engage on his E. Even if he misses it, it’s more than likely that he’s right beside the target, enabling him to cast his taunt. The real magic, though, is in his ultimate. It has a pretty long cast range, so he can get in and cast it on an ally that finds himself in trouble from afar, and more often than not, save their life.</p>



<p>Combining Galio’s ultimate with Kalista’s, followed by Galio’s E, is a <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control chain</a> consisting of three, yes THREE, knock-ups. Allow Galio to channel his taunt and what you’re left with is a player yelling at his screen bellowing CC needs a nerf.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Amumu</strong></h2>

<p>Thanks to his mini rework, the Sad Mummy has been absolutely wrecking the support role in Season 11. Amumu can abuse his two Q charges to stack crowd control on a target, and his natural tankiness makes him hard to trade with.</p>



<p>However, there is one particular synergy between these two champions when they reach level 6. Kalista’s ultimate allows Amumu to dash into the enemy team, knocking them up, and he can immediately chain this knock-up with his own ultimate, which is an <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AOE</a> stun. This combo is amazing for early skirmishes, late-game teamfights, and everything in between.</p>

<h2><strong>7. Morgana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12699" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-kalista-in-league-of-legends-morgana.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>But if a tank isn&#8217;t your preferred playstyle in LoL, then we highly recommend you Morgana in combination with Kalista. Out of all enchanters and mages, Morgana is the one champion that absolutely needs to be in melee range with her enemies. And Kalista&#8217;s R is the perfect setup for that!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever Morgana is launched forward, she can immediately use her own ultimate while the enemies are still airborne. Not only does this help to secure stun on multiple targets but it also creates a chaotic situation for the opposing team. Being knocked up and chained by Morgana is a big disadvantage for you at the start of the team fight, so you want to escape it as soon as possible. And that&#8217;s where Kalista comes into play!</p>



<p>Although her passive is incredible for kiting and running away, it&#8217;s amazing for chasing enemies down too. Hopping after every attack means that you&#8217;ll always be near your prey. On top of Morgana&#8217;s other <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> tools, this is a clean winning combination for Kalista!</p>



<p>Those are the 7 best supports for Kalista in season 11!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Samira is arguably the best ADC champion in season 11 of League of Legends. Her <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/riot-games-and-the-200-years-experience-aphelios-meme-explained/" data-type="post" data-id="9903" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&#8220;200 years&#8221;</a> ability kit allows her to not only deal massive damage from afar but to overpower opponents from close range too. Her dash mechanic resets on a champion kill or assist; her wind wall blocks spells in a 360-degree circle, and her lifesteal is often higher than Soraka&#8217;s healing. But all jokes aside, Samira is one of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-one-tricks-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="12402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best champions to main</a> as an ADC and you need to know which supports suit her best in season 11!</p>



<p>The supports that often go very well with Samira are tanks. This is because they can always engage first and create space for Samira to come in second and unleash her ultimate all around. That doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t play an enchanter or a mage with Samira, but you might lose a few engage opportunities if you do.</p>



<p>That said, let&#8217;s talk about the top 7 best supports for Samira!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Alistar</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12838" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-alistar.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Alistar is a classic tank. He&#8217;s got a knock-up, a stun, and a heal &#8211; everything that Samira can ask for. But if you want to utilize this combo to the fullest, then you need to understand how Samira&#8217;s passive works and how she benefits from the presence of Alistar.</p>



<p>Daredevil Impulse allows Samira to dash to any enemy champion if they&#8217;re already in some crowd control effect. But if that is a knock-up, then Samira will also keep that target airborne for 0.75 seconds longer. So each time Alistar goes for a Headbutt + Pulverize combo, Samira can simply right-click the affected enemy to get in range and keep him in the air. This is an extremely powerful mechanic that&#8217;s available from level 1!</p>



<p>Obviously, Alistar has this ability combo available on a fairly short cooldown. This means that he and Samira can repeat this process all the time and grab kills during the laning phase. Alistar&#8217;s stun is also helpful, but Samira can&#8217;t extend that duration.</p>



<h2><strong>2. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12840" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-leona.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Leona + Samira is one of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/fun-bot-lane-combos/" data-type="post" data-id="11538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most feared bot lane combos</a> in League of Legends. It&#8217;s true that Leona doesn&#8217;t have any knock-up effects, but she brings three separate crowd control abilities to the table &#8211; two stuns and a root. Samira can use all of these effects to dash herself to the affected opponents and start dealing damage.</p>



<p>The strongest point that these two champions have is team fights. Leona is known to be the queen of engaging supports and that&#8217;s not without a reason. Her ultimate can catch multiple enemies off guard and create the perfect situation for Samira. Samira excels in chaotic situations where she can jump forward and activate her ultimate. She can then start executing champions once they&#8217;re pretty low.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Leona can be of great help to Samira when it comes to kiting. Leona&#8217;s Q is another ability of a short cooldown so she can stop the enemies that are going for Samira.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Blitzcrank</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14682" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-blitzcrank.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Steam Golem is a fantastic partner for Samira. As many of you know, Blitz is known for yoinking champions towards his team for an easy pick. Samira can follow this up nicely. By focusing on the target that was picked by Blitz, Samira can easily land a full ability rotation with autos weaved in, leaving her at rank A or S on her passive, ready to smash that R key and obliterate the remainder of the team.</p>



<p>We did mention Samira does well with knock-ups, and Blitz has just that on his E ability. This synergy comes especially handy during the laning phase, where every additional fraction of a second that your opponent cannot trade back gives you an advantage over them.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Braum</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14683" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-braum.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Given Samira’s tendency to just dive into the enemy team and, well, do Samira things, a support that can follow through and, well, support her is almost a necessity. The Heart of the Freljord can do just that. With his Stand Behind Me ability, he can dash to Samira right after she dives into the enemy team and support her from there.</p>



<p>His ult is an AOE knock-up and slow, making it an excellent tool for engaging and disengaging a fight. His Unbreakable makes him a projectile sponge, shielding Samira and the rest of his team from incoming damage.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14685" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-thresh.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Thresh and Samira have a rather unique synergy. This is because Samira no longer needs to look for the kamikaze plays into the enemy because she now has something she typically lacks: a way out. Thresh’s lantern is precisely for that purpose; it allows Samira to dive into the enemy team, take out a target if she’s able to burst it down, and get out quickly.</p>



<p>Apart from this, Thresh has an excellent setup for Samira; his Q and E both enable Samira to proc her passive to dash into range and poke her opponents. A good Thresh player will be able to earn kills for his ADC and keep her safe from incoming attackers.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Pyke</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14684" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-samira-pyke.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>I guess we have all realized already that Samira is a pretty aggressive champion. In the support role, there really aren’t many supports that are more aggressive than Pyke. He can threaten by simply having his Q available, which will be more than enough to frighten many opposing players. This is because, at this point, everybody knows how scary Pyke can be if fed a few kills early on. Thanks to his ultimate, every kill he is involved in becomes a gold mine, where he shares extra gold between himself and the last ally that assisted in the kill.</p>



<p>Whenever Pyke does choose to go in, a Q E combo will deal enough damage and keep the target stunned long enough for Samira to join in for a pretty heavy trade.</p>

<h2><strong>7. Galio</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12839" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-samira-galio.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Galio isn&#8217;t the most traditional support champion in League of Legends but no one can argue that he is the very best one for Samira in season 11. All of his abilities are great for aiding Samira, especially his E. This spell knocks up the first enemy (or enemies) hit in Galio&#8217;s path and triggers Samira&#8217;s passive. Thanks to this, Samira and Galio can play quite aggressively in the lane, since Galio has his taunt to keep their opponents in place and secure the kills.</p>



<p>But the most important synergy between these champions comes after level 6. Galio&#8217;s ultimate is an <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AoE knock-up</a> and can be used to protect Samira. And with Samira, he has multiple ways of using this ability, depending on the situation.</p>



<p>For example, Galio can wait for Samira to enter the fight first and get into melee range, then use his R and knock everyone up. This will allow Samira to keep them in the air and get a bunch of kills. Or, Galio can wait until their opponents jump onto Samira to counter-attack their effort and turn the tide of the battle. In the end, he can use this ability on another teammate to engage in a fight so Samira can join right after.</p>



<p>And that makes Galio one of the best supports for Samira in season 11 of League of Legends!</p>

<p>Even though Lucian is more of a mid-lane pick than ADC in season 11, no one can argue that he is still one of the strongest marksmen on Summoner&#8217;s Rift. His base damage is incredibly high and thanks to his simple yet effective ability kit, Lucian can carry most games if played correctly. The build that most Lucian players run currently revolves around Galeforce and one-shotting squishy targets. So if you play Lucian in the bot lane, you need to know which are the best supports for you in season 11 of LoL!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how these 7 different support champions can aid Lucian in the laning phase and outside of it!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Braum</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12904" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-braum.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Lucian + Braum is one of the most popular <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bot lane combos in League of Legends</a>. Their synergy surpasses that of most other matchups and even rivals that of Rakan and Xayah. And one of the reasons for this lies in their passive abilities.</p>



<p>Braum&#8217;s passive applies a debuff on the targeted enemy which requires 3 auto-attacks or abilities to turn into stun. Lucian&#8217;s passive allows him to double-shot after each ability used which also counts as 2 separate auto-attacks. In combination, both of these champions can work together to instantly stun a target. For example, Braum can throw his Q, and Lucian can quickly dash and use his 2 auto-attacks. This is such an advantage in 2v2 fights in the bot lane, especially early on.</p>



<p>However, Braum&#8217;s wall is another benefit for Lucian. This ability blocks projectiles and it can be used to shield Lucian while he&#8217;s channeling his ultimate. Obviously, Lucian&#8217;s R is one of the hardest-hitting abilities in the entire game, but it can also be interrupted. So Braum for the win!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="577" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-1024x577.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12906" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-1024x577.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-768x433.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-1536x866.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-150x85.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-750x423.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-thresh-1140x643.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Thresh and Lucian is another favorite combo for many bot lane duos. People say that Thresh is the perfect support for all marksmen champions in the game. And even if we can&#8217;t agree 100% with that, the truth is that he is one of the best supports for Lucian in season 11.</p>



<p>With Thresh, Lucian can play both aggressively and defensively. Thresh has a lot of tools to outplay his opponents, starting with his Q. This ability can set up Lucian&#8217;s damage and start the chain <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>. Lucian requires crowd control to fully channel his ultimate, so Thresh can help a lot with both his E and R.</p>



<p>The lantern is another element that this duo has. Lucian can go deep into enemy territory or dive on turrets because Thresh can simply throw his lantern and secure an exit for him. On the other hand, Thresh can also go deep and pull Lucian to him whenever he has an enemy locked.</p>



<p>All in all, this duo has a very fun dynamic and it&#8217;s an absolute blast to play. We highly recommend roaming and invading whenever you play Lucian and Thresh since they have enough damage and CC to overpower anyone on the Rift.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14565" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-nami.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Based on Lucian&#8217;s recent &#8220;rework&#8221; in which his autos are empowered when he is healed, shielded, or buffed, Nami is a great pick to go with the gunslinging sentinel. Her E stacks nicely with Lucian&#8217;s aforementioned passive, granting them a quick burst of damage very few duos can match.</p>



<p>Additionally, Nami provides an exceptional kill setup with her Q and ult, bringing some crowd control to the table. A locked-down target stands very little chance when being burst down by this hard-hitting duo.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14564" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>When talking about locking down a target, there is no way the Radiant Dawn will be left out. Offering a hard-to-beat <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC chain</a> with her E Q R combo, Leona gives Lucian plenty of time to damage a target, which he can easily follow up by getting in range with his own E.</p>



<p>Be careful with this combo, as it is going to be very difficult to counter. Lucian has bonus movement speed if he hits a target marked by his W, and Leona is a very sticky support by herself.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Senna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14566" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-senna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>I have to admit I&#8217;m quite a fan of the lore, so seeing this pair synergizing well together does put a smile on my face. The poke they can have with their respective Q abilities is obnoxious, to say the least, add in the fact that Senna&#8217;s Q is a heal, and therefore Lucian&#8217;s passive empowers his autos, and you have a recipe for nightmares.</p>



<p>As if slowly whittling down your opponents from an absurd distance isn&#8217;t enough for you, do remember that Senna scales indefinitely as the match progresses, meaning every couple of minutes, she can harass you from even further down the lane, dealing even more damage every time.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Amumu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14563" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-lucian-amumu.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This one may come as a bit of a surprise to many, but the Sad Mummy has quickly become a reliable support ever since his Q was changed. To those who don&#8217;t know, Amumu now has two Q charges. Yes, that&#8217;s right, just after you feel like you should be playing in Korean solo queue because you sidestepped his first Bandage Toss, you get hit by the second charge. Sounds frustrating? Good, because it most definitely is.</p>



<p>Amumu&#8217;s CC and natural tankiness make him difficult to deal with in the bottom lane, as he now has a lot more playmaking potential thanks to that additional Q charge. His ultimate is an absolute beast in teamfights and skirmishes, as it is hard <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> in a wide area and, when an Amumu hits a 5-man ultimate and has a team that can follow that up properly, it&#8217;s a guaranteed ace for that squad.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Nautilus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12905" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-lucian-nautilus.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Similar to the previous two choices, Nautilus is a &#8220;free win&#8221; support pick for Lucian in season 11. The power of this combo comes from Nautiilus&#8217;s incredible <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control abilities</a> and Lucian&#8217;s damage. And whenever they&#8217;re together, the enemy team should work twice as hard to shut them down.</p>



<p>Nautilus has the most kill potential in the bot lane than any other support champion. Since level 1, he is able to not only grab a champion but to provide a root effect through his auto-attack. This is extremely powerful for invading the enemy jungle or rushing a level 2 fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Nautilus is also great in <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-attack-move-orb-walk-and-kite-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="8678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kiting</a> for Lucian and <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-peel-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peeling</a>. In team fights, the low cooldown on his passive allows him to continually snare targets that are trying to reach Lucian. And combined with his ultimate that knocks up everyone in the lane of the selected target, we can agree that Nautilus can keep Lucian safe.</p>



<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that Lucian should always play recklessly. In truth, Nautilus doesn&#8217;t have any shield or healing to help out Lucian. But if both players understand how these two champions work together, then they can be one of the most powerful pairs in League of Legends.</p>



<p>And those are the top 7 best supports for Lucian in season 11!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Jinx made a bombastic reappearance in season 11. The rework of the items gave her brand new powers and now she is one of the strongest ADC champions on Summoner&#8217;s Rift. Her direct damage is often described as &#8220;unbelievable&#8221; and there aren&#8217;t too many champions that can endure her crazy rockets. So in this guide, we&#8217;ll be talking about the top 7 best supports that you can play for Jinx in season 11.</p>



<p>Similar to Kog&#8217;Maw or Ezreal, Jinx needs a support that can get her through the laning phase. She is extremely vulnerable before level 6 due to not having any mobility and no defensive spells. This type of support can either be a tank or an enchanter, with both of those categories having unique tools and playstyles.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s examine the best supports for Jinx in Season 11 and how they can work with her!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12949" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-nami.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Nami is easily the enchanter <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/web-stories/top-5-best-off-meta-supports-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="web-story" data-id="12797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">support with the most potential</a> in the bot lane. She can play League of Legends both aggressively and defensively and gain lots and lots of advantages throughout the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key element to understand here is Nami&#8217;s W. This isn&#8217;t only a simple healing spell, but much much more. Whenever Nami uses her W, a tidal wave bounces off her primary target to either heal an ally or damage an enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the reason why this is perfect for Jinx is that Nami can position herself to constantly poke and fend off any potential danger for Jinx. The tidal wave grants her safe trades because she can heal her health while she deals damage.</p>



<p>Other than that, Nami&#8217;s Q and Jinx&#8217;s E synergize very well too. Jinx can throw the chompers while the enemy is up in the air from Nami&#8217;s bubble for an instant root. The same can be said for their ultimates, which are both long-range abilities. A knock-up into a rocket blast is usually the best finisher move for this pair!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Blitz</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12947" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-blitzcrank.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Blitz has a very dominating presence in the bot lane. His grab is one of the deadliest abilities early on in the game, especially to champions that can&#8217;t escape it. There are a couple of ways you can synergize Blitz and Jinx in the laning phase, so let&#8217;s start explaining them.</p>



<p>First, Blitz&#8217;s E is one of the best setups for Jinx&#8217;s E. Whenever Blitz knocks a champion up in the air, Jinx can throw her chompers to secure the root effect. This also works with Blitz&#8217;s Q, but Jinx has to be careful because opponents would often Flash away after being hooked by Blitz.</p>



<p>For the entire laning phase, Blitz can position himself in the frontline to scare off the enemies. He is quite tanky and he doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to use his hook. This will give enough freedom to Jinx farm and scale for the mid and late game.</p>



<p>After level 6, the kill potential of this duo doubles. Both of their ultimates do a lot of damage early on, so this is the perfect time for Jinx and Blitz to look for 2v2 skirmishes. They might not be the strongest pair in team fights, but they can <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-attack-move-orb-walk-and-kite-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="8678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kite</a> well and deal burst damage, especially if they&#8217;re the ones engaging.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Braum</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14557" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-braum.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Braum is a fantastic support to have when playing Jinx. Thanks to her additional range when using her rockets, Jinx has a really easy time when trying to proc Braum&#8217;s passive. Stack her own Flame Chompers on top of that, as well as Braum&#8217;s very own Glacial Fissure when he reaches level 6, and you have a champion that has no other choice but to endure the pain coming from Jinx and her loyal muscly support.</p>



<p>Additionally, Braum has different ways of saving Jinx, most notably his E ability, Unbreakable, which blocks projectiles coming in, which can come in very handy when Jinx is trying to trade. His W grants both him and his ally bonus resistances, which are lovely to have in said trades as well.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14559" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-thresh.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Jinx does not have that much self-peel; she only has her chompers to rely on, which is really not optimal if she has highly mobile assassins on her tail. Thresh can compensate for this, as he has plenty of tools to stop a champion dead on their tracks. I believe we mention this in nearly every article Thresh is mentioned, but his lantern is just so good we cannot possibly overlook it, especially for a champion like Jinx.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Thresh has an amazing kill setup with his other abilities, meaning a good Thresh player will be able to Q his way into the midgame with a fed Jinx by his side, paving the way for a much more comfortable game.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14558" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Janna is great at keeping Jinx safe while she farms and scales into the mid and late game, where she shines her brightest. If and when Jinx gets to a point where she&#8217;s dealing tons of damage, the enemy team is definitely going to try an all-in to take her out, and Janna is more than prepared to deal with that.</p>



<p>Her whirlwinds and ultimate are exceptional disengage tools that can help keep even the stickiest of assassins away from your carry.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Yuumi</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14560" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-jinx-supps-yuumi.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This is a tricky one. We did say Jinx required a support that carried her into the mid and late game since she is one of the best scaling ADCs in the current meta. Yuumi is not exactly the type of support that can do that exceptionally well, but if this duo reaches mid-game on even terms with their opponents, they can absolutely take over a match.</p>



<p>Yuumi does provide some sustain in lane, but Jinx would have to survive being the sole focus of the enemy team, pretty much all on her own. That would leave her very open to hard engagers like Leona, Pyke, Nautilus, and others, so it would be best to play this duo into a bot lane without much early game kill pressure, like Ezreal and Senna.</p>



<h2><strong>7. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12948" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jinx-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And lastly, we have Leona. This is one of the most powerful picks in the bot lane in season 11. The reason for this is because Leona has an insane amount of <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a> which works perfectly in this burst meta.</p>



<p>The playstyle of Jinx and Leona is pretty easy too. All Jinx has to do is follow up on Leona&#8217;s engages. And all Leona has to do is be as aggressive as possible. She doesn&#8217;t have shields or heals for Jinx, so she has to make up for it by being constantly in the face of their opponents and stop them from attacking. The best defense is often offense, and that&#8217;s certainly true here.</p>



<p>But the real power of the Jinx + Leona combo comes after level 6. Leona is the queen of team fights because she can control the entire enemy team with her <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>. This creates the ideal opportunity for Jinx to unleash her rockets and deal <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AoE damage</a> all around. Leona can also lock enemies in place so Jinx can throw her ultimate from afar.</p>



<p>And those are the 7 best supports for Jinx in season 11!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Despite Miss Fortune&#8217;s hot start in season 11, she is currently near the low end of the spectrum of ADC picks. Many arguments can be given as to why MF isn&#8217;t the strongest champion right now, but none of them can actually deny her viability. Miss Fortune has always been a solid pick, especially in matches where you have a killer wombo-combo team composition. She brings a massive <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AoE burst damage</a> to the table, so she&#8217;ll always be a good marksman to main. And in this guide, we&#8217;ll go over the best supports that you need to know when playing as or with Miss Fortune!</p>



<p>On a general note, any champion that can stun or snare the enemy is a good pick for supporting Miss Fortune. Despite her damage potential, she lacks the tools to keep her targets in place. Opponents that can constantly run away from MF are the most difficult to beat, so she needs some help in that regard.</p>



<p>Now let&#8217;s talk about the best supports for Miss Fortune in season 11 and see how you can utilize their powers!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13302" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking for the absolute best combo for Miss Fortune in the bot lane, then we say go for Leona. These two champions have an insane amount of synergy and can face off against any other matchup.</p>



<p>First off, the Miss Fortune + Leona combo should be played very offensively. Leona is a natural when it comes to forcing fights and MF is great at following with bursts of damage. As soon as level 2, this pair can look for skirmishes thanks to Leona&#8217;s E and Q. However, Miss Fortune can also be the initiator if she captures an enemy with the Make It Rain ability. This will allow Leona to easily hit her skill shot on the slowed opponent.</p>



<p>But the biggest power-up of this combo comes only after level 6. With both ultimates unlocked, MF and Leona can unleash true chaos. Nothing is scarier than being caught in the center of Leona&#8217;s R while Miss Fortune is right there channeling her bullet barrage. From then on, the combo can look for fights around the map whenever they have their ultimates ready to use.</p>



<p>Leona is the easiest support partner you can pick for Miss Fortune and we highly recommend her!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Maokai</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13303" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-maokai.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Currently, Makoi and Miss Fortune is the combination that yields the most victories for MF. Their win rate is over 55%, which really speaks of how well this pair can do in a given matchup.</p>



<p>During the laning phase, Miss Fortune and Maokai don&#8217;t need to be aggressive at all. Maokai can keep MF safe by stuffing the bushes with his saplings and occasionally walking up to the enemies to assert dominance. Both of these champions have slow effects, which can really help them in engaging in a fight, especially Maokai.</p>



<p>Like Leona, Maokai has a killer-support ultimate for Miss Fortune. His roots cover the entire width of the lane and the river. They last for a very long time, nearly matching the channeling of MF&#8217;s Bullet Time. When combined together, this is a recipe for true disaster because Maokai ensures the entire damage of Miss Fortune&#8217;s ultimate, which we all know is totally broken.</p>



<p>So don&#8217;t hesitate to try some Maokai + Miss Fortune action!</p>

<h2><strong>3. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="653" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-1024x653.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13304" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-1024x653.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-300x191.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-768x490.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-150x96.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-750x479.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami-1140x727.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-miss-fortune-nami.jpg 1332w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Nami can be your backup plan when choosing a support for Miss Fortune in case you get tired of tanks. She provides quite a lot of benefit to the matchup, but most importantly &#8211; healing. The duo sits at over 53% win rate, which is more than most other<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> duos in League of Legends</a>.</p>



<p>Ebb and Flow, Nami&#8217;s W, is a fantastic ability to have during the laning phase. It&#8217;s both a poking and a healing tool and experienced Nami players always try to achieve both effects when using it. And since Miss Fortune doesn&#8217;t always build lifesteal, this is a pretty handy thing to have.</p>



<p>Similar to Leona, MF can use her E to slow down their enemies so Nami can secure her knock-up. This will create a small chain of <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> which the duo can use to deal damage. Nami&#8217;s E is another incredibly useful spell and can be used to power up Miss Fortune&#8217;s Qs.</p>



<p>Once the ultimates are ready, you can synergize them to keep enemies knocked up and slowed for the entire duration of Bullet Time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And those are the top 3 best supports for Miss Fortune in season 11 of League of Legends!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Varus&#8217;s popularity spiked a lot in season 11 of League of Legends. A couple of buffs to his damage combined with the mythic item changes opened a way for this marksman to shine on the Rift. Currently, there are two different build paths for Varus. One focuses on his on-hit damage and attack speed. And the other build favors <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/lethality-league-of-legends-how-does-it-work-updated/" data-type="post" data-id="7321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lethality</a> items and funnels all the power in Varus&#8217;s Q. But whatever is your preference, you still need to know which supports are the best for Varus in season 11!</p>



<p>Varus has a very specific playstyle in League, one that only a few other marksmen have. He requires a certain type of support that can enhance his ability to carry. Generally, the support champions that best suit Varus offers a lot of crowd control effects. But there are some that excel in this, way more than the others.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s check them out!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Morgana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13088" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-morgana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Whenever players see Morgana + Varus in the bot lane, they&#8217;re usually terrified. This <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bot lane combo</a> is simply overloaded with damage right from the start of the game.</p>



<p>Level 1 as Varus and Morgana should be aggressive. This means that you can always go for an invade or a sneaky snare from the brush. The combined power of Morgana&#8217;s root and Varus&#8217;s arrow is enough to secure a kill in the early game. And experienced players try to take advantage of it.</p>



<p>But Morgana comes with another benefit for Varus &#8211; her spell shield. Varus doesn&#8217;t have any mobility and no defensive abilities either. His build is always offensive, so having a spell shield to keep him out of trouble is almost mandatory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After level 6, Varus and Morgana have a way easier time dealing with their opponents. Varus&#8217;s R travels faster than Morgana&#8217;s Q, so he can always take the first turn in snaring their opponent. Morgana can follow this either with Q or her ultimate to lock the target down. This makes it easy for Varus to hit his empowered arrow and get the kills.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13087" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Leona has a very defined playstyle in the bot lane &#8211; <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a> and tanking. And it&#8217;s quite obvious why she perfectly fits Varus and how he usually plays the laning phase.</p>



<p>Leona provides a long duration of crowd control, which Varus desperately needs for successfully landing his Q. But the advantage of Leona over other supports is that she doesn&#8217;t rely on her ultimate to do this. Both of her Q and E abilities can hold a target down as soon as level 2. This opens fantastic opportunities for early kills in the lane.</p>



<p>The kill potential of Varus and Leona doubles when they unlock their ultimates. Combined, they can chain <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> a target for over 5 seconds, which is more than enough to kill anyone in the game</p>



<p>On the other hand, Leona is extremely good at kiting in team fights. She can stop multiple enemy champions as they try to attack Varus. And since Varus doesn&#8217;t often build defensive items, this is very welcomed.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Zyra</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13089" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-varus-zyra.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Zyra plays a similar role to Morgana when she is paired with Varus. However, Zyra offers a lot more damage than Morgana throughout the game and it&#8217;s usually considered the very best among the supports for Varus in season 11.</p>



<p>One of the biggest advantages that Zyra has over Morgana is the fact that her root travels through minions. This makes it way easier to land the ability, which in turn lets Varus secure his arrow. After level 6, Varus can enhance Zyra&#8217;s damage by locking people in place so Zyra can damage them with her ultimate. But this works the other way around as well.</p>



<p>Many players in the lower elos underestimate the power of Zyra&#8217;s plants. But experienced players will always think twice about engaging Varus or Zyra when these plants are up. In short, they do massive amounts of damage to champions, especially in the laning phase. So make sure to spawn Zyra&#8217;s plants whenever the enemies are preparing to engage. They can sometimes turn the tide of the battle in your favor.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14044" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-nami.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Varus goes really well with Nami’s kit, regardless of what build path he chooses for the match. Her E is sort of a double buff, where the bonus damage goes nicely with on-hit Varus, and the slow is of course a very welcome addition, especially for lethality Varus, helping him find his target more often.</p>



<p>Nami does also bring a hefty amount of sustain to the lane, which Varus really lacks. This helps him stay longer in lane to farm and trade. Also, Nami provides a nice movement speed bonus with her passive, meaning Varus will have an easier time dodging abilities and positioning well to deal damage.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Yuumi</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14045" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-yuumi.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>When talking about sustain, we cannot leave Yuumi out of the picture. Bringing both healing and shielding into the game, she does an excellent job at keeping her carry healthy. This does, however, come at the cost of redirecting the grand majority of focus onto Varus in this case, since she does become untargetable when attached, so the enemy will only be able to target Varus when coming in for a poke.</p>



<p>Yuumi does also amp Varus’ damaging stats thanks to the passive portion of her W ability, further increasing Varus’ damage output in general. Last but definitely not least is the crowd control chain that these two can set up. Three hits from Yuumi’s ultimate root the target long enough for Varus to hit a free ult, locking the target down for a considerable amount of time.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14043" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-lulu.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Similar to various supports in this list, Lulu has an on-hit bonus that helps Varus immensely. She has an attack speed steroid which also serves as a small damage amplifier. Shields for sustain and her ever-annoying polymorph ability to abruptly shut down any dive onto Varus.</p>



<p>Her ultimate, Wild Growth, is a sort of lifeline ability that would allow either her or Varus to survive very sticky situations with its bonus health on cast. Lulu by herself is really one of the most annoying supports in Season 11, but paired with an ADC she synergizes well with, and you have a recipe for a dreadful laning phase for the opposition.</p>

<h2><strong>7. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14042" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-varus-supports-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This partnership is one of the best for Varus. Janna is capable of keeping Varus safe thanks to her many tools to break an engage. Whirlwinds are useful for setups or escapes, and her ultimate can halt even the most daring assault, giving her allies some much-needed space between them and the enemies, as well as a generous amount of healing.</p>



<p>Janna also boasts an AD steroid that Varus can make great use of, especially with his range. All in all, this is an excellent duo to have down in the bottom lane.</p>



<p>And those are the top 7 best supports for Varus in season 11 of League of Legends!</p>

<p>Draven is one of the few marksmen that wasn&#8217;t majorly affected by the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/riot-reveals-new-mythic-items-and-item-shop-changes-for-the-next-season/" data-type="post" data-id="8954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mythic item changes</a> in season 11. His overall dominating laning phase got a bit enhanced and now he is one of the<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-hyper-carries/" data-type="post" data-id="9744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> strongest champions to carry games</a> with. But Draven isn&#8217;t a self-sufficient champion and he lacks many important elements, such as mobility and defensiveness. And that&#8217;s where the best supports for Draven come into play!</p>



<p>Draven should be and often is the bully in the bot lane. He prefers supports that are either hyper-aggressive or champions that can protect him while he&#8217;s being aggressive. But there are clear winners in both of these categories, so let&#8217;s talk about the top 7 best supports for Draven in season 11 of League of Legends!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-13137" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-thresh.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Thresh is one of the most popular supports in League of Legends. But he is also one of the best champions to play in combination with Draven. Almost all of the tools that Thresh brings to the table can in some way enhance Draven&#8217;s performance. So let&#8217;s examine them.</p>



<p>One of the most notable things about Thresh is his <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a>. His long-range Q can catch enemies off guard and help Thresh bounce them back with E or slow them down with R. This allows Draven to continually hit their opponents until they die. One of the biggest weaknesses of Draven is the inability to <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> targets, so Thresh solves that in a way.</p>



<p>But Thresh has one more key thing &#8211; his lantern. This is one of the best mobility spells that a support champion can offer to his allies. The lantern helps Draven escape sticky situations or quickly reach his targets. These two champions can play very aggressively as long as the Thresh player is experienced in landing hooks and throwing lanterns in the right spots.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Blitzcrank</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="538" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-1024x538.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-13135" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-300x158.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-768x403.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-150x79.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-750x394.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank-1140x599.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-blitzcrank.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Blitzcrank and Draven have a very similar playstyle to Thresh and Draven. But Blitzcrank is a much simpler champion than his support rival so the combo between him and Draven is way easier to execute.</p>



<p>For example, the easiest way to get a kill as Blitzcrank and Draven is to pull someone towards you with Q and knock him up with E. This is enough crowd control for any stage of the game, simply because of how much damage Draven can do. And you can repeat this process throughout the match.</p>



<p>Many players agree that Blitz has an advantage over Thresh when supporting Draven because his Q displaces the target, rather than locking him into place. Any champion that can bring squishy targets to Draven and hold them down is a good support, but Blitz simply excels at it.</p>



<p>And let&#8217;s not forget Blitzcrank&#8217;s ultimate. His silence is another form of CC because it also stops champions from using Flash too. All in all, Blitz is one of the best supports to choose whenever you see Draven locked in a solo queue.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-13136" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-150x89.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-draven-nami.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Nami isn&#8217;t anywhere near to Thresh or Blitz in terms of playstyle, but she can aid Draven in different ways. Remember, Draven can also be paired with supportive champions, such as Soraka, Janna, or Lulu. But Nami is simply the best for supporting him in particular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important thing that Nami brings to this combo is her heal. This is both a defensive and an offensive ability since the healing wave bounces off both allies and enemies. Experienced Nami players will always look to damage enemies while healing their allies. And since Draven doesn&#8217;t have any poke damage except his auto-attacks, this is great for trading early on in lane.</p>



<p>But Nami also offers two different knock-up effects. Both her Q and R have considerably long range and can be used for either engaging or disengaging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And the last thing that not too many players abuse as Nami is her E ability. Whenever used, this spell enhances the next 3 attacks of herself or her chosen allies. These 3 attacks deal bonus damage, but also apply a slow effect on the enemy for 1 second. You can clearly see why this is a huge benefit for Draven in any type of scenario.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Leona</strong></h2>

<p>When talking about locking down an enemy in place, few can do it as well as Leona. Her E Q combo is quite lengthy. Add in her ultimate after reaching level 6 and your target will not stand a chance, Draven will have too much freedom to deal absurd amounts of damage to a target that will not even be able to trade back.</p>



<p>A really good added bonus is that Leona is inherently very tanky thanks to her W. There&#8217;s almost no way the enemy can hope to burst her down, and given her Q has a relatively low cooldown, extended trades would be heavily beneficial for the Draven and Leona duo.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Soraka</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14039" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-soraka.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Draven likes being aggressive, but he doesn’t have the biggest of ranges, meaning he often finds himself getting slapped back when he goes in to poke a bit. Soraka will help mitigate any sort of damage Draven receives in such trades.</p>



<p>Another sweet trading tool Soraka brings to the table is her silence. This will block enemy champions from using any abilities, meaning hard engage supports such as Pyke or even Pantheon will not be able to jump on top of either laner as long as they are inside the abilities area of effect.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Pyke</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14038" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-pyke.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Well, we did just say he was a hard engaging support right? Draven loves this type of company, as it helps him get into fights more often. Pyke is sort of a more aggressive, damage-heavy hooking support, so while he does not really have much utility such as Thresh’s lantern, for example, Pyke does excel at dealing damage and bursting down squishies.</p>



<p>His ultimate is fantastic as well, it is an execute that gives the full amount of kill gold to whoever was the most recent ally to damage the enemy and get the assist. This gets even better because this stacks with Draven’s passive. You read that right, should an enemy die to this duo, Pyke’s R will grant Draven the full amount of gold from the kill, and Draven himself will have his passive triggered, making this duo a phenomenal gold snowball.</p>



<h2><strong>7. Nautilus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14037" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-draven-supports-nautilus.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>I guess we can summarize and say Draven quite enjoys a support that has a hook. Similar to the hooking supports above, Nautilus has good engage potential and can lock a target down for Draven to fling axes at the target.</p>



<p>His point and click ult serves as a fantastic initiation tool, especially if Nautilus is able to follow up with his Q and passive root. As a natural tank, Nautilus is able to soak up a lot of retaliation damage for Draven.</p>



<p>And those are the top 7 best supports for Draven in season 11 of League of Legends! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Vayne is a very unique ADC champion in League of Legends. Not only is she able to 1v9 games, but she&#8217;s also a difficult champion to master. Vayne doesn&#8217;t have any <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AoE ability</a>, and her playstyle mostly revolves around kiting the enemy with her tumbles. And although she&#8217;s powerful on her own, she does extremely well with a few supports in particular. So, who are the best supports for Vayne?</p>



<p>With so many champions able to fill the support role, it&#8217;s difficult to find the perfect one for Vayne. Yes, she typically requires a &#8220;supportive&#8221; support, someone who can get her through the laning phase, but that&#8217;s not always the case.</p>



<p><strong>Generally, Vayne works best with enchanter supports such as Lulu, Soraka, and Yuumi, but she can also do really well with tank supports because they can <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-peel-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peel</a> for her. And so, here I&#8217;ve chosen the top 5 best supports for Vayne in League of Legends. All of these champions have a great level of synergy with Vayne&#8217;s kit, so they&#8217;re always a good choice. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Take a look!</strong></p>



<h2><strong>1. Taric</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12992" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-taric.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Taric</strong> may not be the most popular champion in League of Legends, but he&#8217;s damn good at supporting late game ADCs. Naturally, Vayne falls in this category, so this makes her and Taric a perfect pair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In season 11, Vayne has the best win rate with Taric. It circles around 56-57%, which is one of the highest numbers you can find among the bot lane synergies. In other words, Vayne and Taric win way more than they lose in all servers and elos of League of Legends.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why is this the case?</em></strong></p>



<p>Well, Taric has a few tools that turn Vayne into a monster marksman. For starters, Taric&#8217;s heal and bonus armor allow Vayne to safely farm in the laning phase. And thanks to it, she can quickly scale and reach her power spikes.</p>



<p>Additionally, Taric has a great stun mechanic. It can be used as a counterplay in situations where enemies jump on Vayne. It will allow Vayne to get away or gain enough range to start hitting back.</p>



<p>But Taric&#8217;s ultimate is what makes the biggest difference here. His Cosmic Radiance is one of the best abilities in the entire game. It turns Vayne invulnerable, allowing her to damage their opponents without losing HP. This is incredibly helpful in all situations, especially in games against assassins or fighters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, when should you play the Taric and Vayne combo. Honestly, any matchup is good as long as you aren&#8217;t particularly aggressive in the early game. Taric doesn&#8217;t have too much damage, and Vayne&#8217;s power depends on levels and gold. So, it&#8217;s best to take it slowly and farm for the late game.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Soraka</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12991" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-soraka.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Soraka</strong> has a similar function when it comes to supporting Vayne. And the biggest reason why she and Vayne have such a high win rate together (around 56%) is that Soraka can keep Vayne alive all the way to the late game.</p>



<p>In other words, Soraka&#8217;s best asset is her heal. She&#8217;s able to continually top Vayne&#8217;s health in lane, making it almost impossible for their opponents to slay them. This is particularly handy in those aggressive matchups, such as Caitlyn, Brand, Leona, and Draven.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Soraka isn&#8217;t just a heal bot in LoL. You can often see experienced players completely outplay their enemies on the champion. Soraka can silence champions and put them into a root. But she can also damage them and slow them down. All of these tools go well with Vayne&#8217;s playstyle, so you have to apply them too.</p>



<p>In team fights, the power of Soraka and Vayne is almost unmatched. This is because Soraka has nearly unlimited healing to support Vayne with. And unless you&#8217;re playing a very bursty assassin, you can&#8217;t really slay Vayne when Soraka is healing her.</p>



<p>Their endurance is further backed up by Soraka&#8217;s ultimate, Wish. This ability is an AoE heal that can single-handedly win a team fight. If used right after Soraka&#8217;s W, Astral Infusion, it can regain 60-70% of Vayne&#8217;s lost health.</p>



<p>And the best part about it is that Grevious Wounds no longer works against Wish. Soraka&#8217;s R heals the target no matter the Grevious Wound percentage. And this means that as long as Soraka has her ultimate ready, Vayne simply can&#8217;t die.</p>



<p>So, that&#8217;s why Soraka is one of the best supports for Vayne in League of Legends.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Yuumi</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12993" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-yummi.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Although <strong>Yuumi</strong> is a ridiculous champion, she&#8217;s also one of the most broken ones. Not too many champions can stay untargetable during the entire fight and still influence it in their favor. So, she and Vayne are a great pair when it comes to team fighting.</p>



<p>When you analyze Yuumi as a champion, you can see that she doesn&#8217;t go well with any champion either. But if her bot laner is weak, she can choose to attach herself to a carry ally. However, in this case, she doesn&#8217;t have to. Vayne is one of the strongest carries in League of Legends, no matter the sore.</p>



<p>Yuumi can tilt players out of their minds simply by keeping her attached ally alive. It&#8217;s insane when you think about how much value she brings to the table while being nearly invincible.</p>



<p>While attached to Vayne, Yuumi can use her ability to kit to slow their enemies down, so Vayne can chase them. She can also root their opponents, making it easier for Vayne to take them down. But most importantly, Yuumi can keep Vayne alive with her heal.</p>



<p>Yuumi&#8217;s E, Zoomies, is one of the<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-healers-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="10495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> most potent heals </a>in the game. It rivals Soraka&#8217;s heal, despite being a single ability. And it&#8217;s incredibly useful to Vayne, especially in the early game.</p>



<p>And the thing that many players forget about Yuumi is the fact that she grants up to 20% AD or AP to the champion she&#8217;s attached. For Vayne, this is very helpful because it amplifies her damage significantly in the late game. And that&#8217;s why her DPS is the highest when paired with Yuumi.</p>

<h2><strong>4. Zyra</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12994" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-zyra.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Zyra</strong> doesn&#8217;t have a heal, a shield, or invulnerability for Vayne. But, she has damage! And a lot of it! Seriously, Zyra is one of the most broken supports in the game and one of the best ones for Vayne.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can&#8217;t often see an exceptional Zyra player in solo queue, but believe me, there are. And when you&#8217;re matched against that kind of a Zyra player, plus a Vayne next to her, it&#8217;s all pain and sadness. Why?</p>



<p>Well, Zyra is a highly aggressive champion in lane. Her abilities are designed in such a way that she can always apply her damage, no matter whether there are minions in the lane or not.</p>



<p><strong><em>What do I mean by this?</em></strong></p>



<p>For example, Zyra&#8217;s E, Grasping Roots, travels through minions and damages every target it hits, no matter the number. Similarly, Zyra&#8217;s Q, Deadly Spines, also damages all enemies in a line for the same amount. This makes it easy for her to poke Vayne&#8217;s opponent and keep them away from her.</p>



<p>One thing that experienced Zyra players also take advantage of is her plants. You can use Zyra&#8217;s plants to block skill shots or torment the enemy ADC when he&#8217;s trying to farm. This alone can win you the lane, so make sure to constantly apply them.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Vayne has a different playstyle when she&#8217;s around Zyra. Although she can engage in a fight from time to time, it&#8217;s often the Zyra player who creates all the kill opportunities for Vayne. It is actually the opposite when playing Vayne with Taric, Soraka, and Yuumi, but it&#8217;s very interesting too.</p>



<p>So, Zyra is one of the best supports for Vayne in League of Legends, without a doubt!</p>



<h2><strong>5. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12990" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>&nbsp;Janna is one of the most versatile support champions in League of Legends. And you can always pick her to try and enable your teammates to carry you to victory. But this is especially true if you have Vayne in your team.</p>



<p>The way Janna and Vayne play the laning phase is very simple. Vayne usually focuses on farming while Janna is there to either poke or protect Vayne while she&#8217;s collecting gold. There aren&#8217;t usually too many 2v2 opportunities that these two champions can take, but they can certainly get a double kill if they outplay their opponents.</p>



<p>Once the laning phase is over, Vayne and Janna can show their true power. During the mid-game, Vayne becomes a monster. And with Janna by her side, Vayne can indefinitely kite and deal damage to anyone in range. On top of a low-cooldown shield, Janna has two knock-up effects and a slow. This is more than enough to keep Vayne safe from all kinds of trouble.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Brand</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12989" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supps-for-vayne-brand.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And finally, we have <strong>Brand</strong>! Brand&#8217;s role in the bot lane is similar to that of Zyra&#8217;s, but it also has differences. He and Vayne have a high win rate of 53%, which is great, considering the fact that Brand can&#8217;t support Vayne in the traditional way.</p>



<p>Now, Brand&#8217;s damage isn&#8217;t as good as Zyra in the early game. However, he has a stun instead of root, which is usually more effective in the 2v2 fights. And if Brand stuns an enemy near a wall, Vayne can use this opportunity to stun that enemy as well.</p>



<p>As the game progresses, Brand&#8217;s damage becomes almost unbearable. In my opinion, his passive is totally broken, especially in the late game. This helps Vayne shred tanks even quicker, so it&#8217;s a great bonus to her damage too.</p>



<p>During the laning phase, Brand is the one that dictates the tempo. Vayne can safely farm if Brand is chasing her opponents away with his W, but that isn&#8217;t always the case. Brand is a short-ranged champion himself, so it does take knowledge and skill to make this combo work.</p>



<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t win with this duo. In fact, I would say that it is one of the easiest <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bot lane combos</a> to play after the 15th minute. Vayne can kite enemies all day long. And Brand only needs to activate his ultimate to spread his passive.</p>



<p>All in all, Brand is one of the best supports for Vayne if played correctly. He provides damage and peeling, two things that not all support champions can provide at the same time. So definitely this duo out!&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>And those are the top 3 best supports for Vayne in season 11 of League of Legends!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the beginning of season 11, Jhin has been a heavily contested pick in the bot lane. Everybody knows that the current meta revolves around burst damage, so Jhin naturally fits this playstyle. His four critical shots can deal massive damage with only a few items and he isn&#8217;t as dependent as many other marksmen champions. However, you still need to know which are the best supports for Jhin in season 11 of League of Legends.</p>



<p>Because Jhin is so unique in the way he plays the bot lane, different support champions can aid him differently. Generally, Jhin goes well with any enchanter he can find, but his favorites are the poke mages. You typically want to avoid tanks such as Alistar or Leona, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t make the combo work. In any case, here are the top 3 best supports for Jhin in season 11!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Brand</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12870" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-brand.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Brand is often considered the best among the supports for Jhin. There are many arguments to back up this statement, but let&#8217;s examine the most important of them.</p>



<p>If Jhin and Brand can be characterized by one thing, then that is massive damage. Brand is a highly aggressive laner in general, and he is usually always in the front casting spells. This benefits Jhin a lot since he can rely on Brand to poke and set up his root. And many forget that Brand&#8217;s burning passive prolongs the mark of Jhin&#8217;s W, so he has more time to fire off this ability and snare someone.</p>



<p>Obviously, whenever Brand stuns an enemy champion with his E+Q combo, he and Jhin can unleash heavy damage and secure a kill in most cases. However, Jhin can also set up Brand&#8217;s damage by lying his traps around the lane. Once their enemies are slowed, Brand can easily land his stun.</p>



<p>After level 6, this combo is better with Brand in the front and Jhin in the back. Jhin&#8217;s ultimate can serve both as a finisher after Brand&#8217;s R or as an opener. In any way, the synergy between these champions is high and you need to take advantage of it!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Morgana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12872" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-morgana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The second support champion that we want to discuss here is Morgana. She might not have the same damage as Brand, but she has other tools such as her spell shield. This ability is very influential in the bot lane because it opens more opportunities than any other form of shielding or healing.</p>



<p>Truthfully, Jhin is a very squishy champion and doesn&#8217;t have any form of mobility (except maybe Galeforce) to escape his opponents. Well, Morgana&#8217;s Black Shield is a cure for all marksmen similar to Jhin because it negates the enemy <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> and oftentimes damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another bonus that Jhin receives by being paired with Morgana is the easy W setup. Morgana doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to hit her Q so Jhin can follow it with his Deadly Flourish. She only needs to put down her W ability for at least one tick and mark the enemy champion. This is very useful, especially in situations when the opponents are running away.</p>



<p>Obviously, level 6 is a big power spike for both of these champions. Morgana&#8217;s stun can be used to lock targets in place while Jhin&#8217;s R can be a finisher. All in all, Morgana is one of the best supports that you can play with Jhin in all matchups.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Nami</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12873" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-nami.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And lastly, we have Nami. With the recent changes to Nami&#8217;s E, she became the go-to support for any mage in the bot lane or any marksmen in the style of Ezreal or Jhin. The reason for this is that Nami&#8217;s E now provides both attack damage and ability power, depending on whether her ally will use basic attacks or spells. This is obviously great for Jhin since he relies on his abilities as much as his attacks, especially his ultimate.</p>



<p>Nami has another very interesting mechanic in the bot lane &#8211; her heal. This ability jumps between enemies and allies, so it causes both damage and healing. The way this ability can benefit Jhin is very simple &#8211; he can position himself aggressively so the wave bounces between him and his opponent. Once the enemy is hit, Jhin can follow this up with a snare and Nami with a bubble.</p>



<p>Both ultimates here a considerably long range and can be synergized. The knock-up effect from Nami&#8217;s R can allow Jhin to land all of his skill shots and secure the kills!</p>



<h2><strong>4. Blitzcrank</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12957" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-blitzcrank.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Blitzcrank</strong> is a great champion to play in combination with Jhin. He has a few exceptional strengths when it comes to the laning phase, which also benefits Jhin.</p>



<p>For starters, Blitzcrank&#8217;s Q, Rocket Grab, is one of the most feared abilities in the entire game. Blitz can use it to bring an enemy next to him and set up a kill for Jhin. Blitzcrank usually casts E immediately after his Q, which also knocks up the enemy.</p>



<p>Well, Jhin can use his W during this time to extended the CC time here. But he can also throw his own E under the knocked-up target, so it may detonate faster. Both champions can coordinate these abilities and lock one target down for a couple of seconds.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Jhin&#8217;s root opens up a fantastic opportunity for Blitz to use his Q. The same can be said for Jhin&#8217;s ultimate, but his root is just the best way for Blitz to grab someone. Both Jhin and Blitz have fantastic damage throughout the game, so they go very well together.</p>



<p>Having Blitzcrank in your team is always beneficial, not just for Jhin. One well-aimed grab in the late game often means an ace, baron, or even victory. Jhin can match this playstyle fantastically, so that&#8217;s why Blitz is one of the best supports for him!</p>



<h2><strong>5. Zyra</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12960" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-zyra.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And <strong>Zyra</strong> is among the best mage supports for Jhin too. Actually, she can even be the very best choice for Jhin in the bot lane, but not everybody knows how to play her. She isn&#8217;t a popular champion, so her playstyle may be a bit weird to some people.</p>



<p>To get an idea, you have to be aggressive as Zyra. Now, this doesn&#8217;t mean that you should blindly engage all the time. But it means that you need to poke and bully your enemies without getting damaged as much in return.</p>



<p>How can you do this effectively?</p>



<p>For example, you can cast your E, Grasping Thorns through the enemy minions while standing behind your own minions. This will snare and damage your enemies while and you&#8217;ll be safe from incoming skill shots. You can use Zyra&#8217;s Q in a similar way. This is very helpful because Zyra is a short-ranged squishy champion.</p>



<p>And how does this help Jhin?</p>



<p>Well, Jhin has a lot of damage, but he is even more squishy than Zyra. He needs a support that will start the fight and draw all the attention. He can follow up Zyra&#8217;s snare with his W or use his ultimate to take their opponents down.</p>



<p>Another way to synergize these two champions is with Zyra&#8217;s plants. You see, any time one of Zyra&#8217;s plants attacks a champion, it also triggers the mark from Jhin&#8217;s W. This is probably the easiest way to apply this ability, so make sure to take advantage of that.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Vel&#8217;Koz</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12959" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-velkoz.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Vel&#8217;koz</strong> is another mage that goes incredibly well with Jhin. Not only does he have a lot of damage, but he is also great at setting up crowd control with Jhin. Vel&#8217;Koz has a bigger range than Morgana, so it&#8217;s also a safer option for supporting Jhin.</p>



<p>The Vel&#8217;Koz and Jhin lane usually goes aggressively. Vel&#8217;Koz has a lot of mana early on, and his abilities don&#8217;t cost as much. He can literally spam spells all day long and scare enemies away from Jhin. This works with all of his abilities, especially his Q, Plasma Fission.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Jhin can use Vel&#8217;Koz&#8217;s poke to either snare enemies or chase them down for a kill. It&#8217;s actually pretty easy to finish off targets once they&#8217;ve been chunked down by a purple octopus monster…</p>



<p>But in all seriousness, Vel&#8217;Koz&#8217;s damage is honestly broken. A big reason for that is his passive, which allows him to deal true damage to his targets. Combined with the high burst that Jhin has, this combo is one of the deadliest on the Rift.</p>



<p>After level 6, Jhin and Vel&#8217;Koz are amazing at 2v2 fights. Both champions can poke effectively and then activate their ultimates to take down their enemies from range. This also works in 5v5 team fights, so their damage is always reliable.</p>



<h2><strong>7. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12958" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-supports-for-jhin-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And lastly, we have <strong>Janna</strong>. Janna isn&#8217;t an aggressive mage, nor is she able to tank enemies for Jhin. However, she is exceptionally good at setting up kills for Jhin and protecting him from their opponents.</p>



<p>One of the best synergies that Janna and Jhin have is combining Janna&#8217;s tornado with Jhin&#8217;s root. For example, Janna can cast her Q, Howling Gale, from a very long distance. And if it hits a target, Jhin can also apply his W, Deadly Flourish, while the target is still in the air. This guarantees a root effect, so it&#8217;s good to do it whenever you can.</p>



<p>But the biggest value that Janna brings to this combo lies elsewhere. You see, all other best supports we mentioned for Jhin were good at dealing damage. But Janna is good at eliminating the damage from their enemies.</p>



<p>Janna&#8217;s E is probably the best shied in the entire game. It is on an incredibly low cooldown, allowing Janna to practically spam it. This makes her laning phase with Jhin a breeze since she can always protect him from poke damage and all-ins.</p>



<p>But Janna&#8217;s ultimate is also a handy ability for Jhin. It heals for a significant amount, especially if Janna has a bit of AP. It can also be used to push back enemies that are engaging on Jhin, which is why it&#8217;s an effective tool against assassins too.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>So there you have it, those are the top 7 best supports for Jhin in League of Legends!</em></strong></p>
