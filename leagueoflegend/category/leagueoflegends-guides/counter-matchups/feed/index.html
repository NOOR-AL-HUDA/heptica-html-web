										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So you&#8217;re playing a game, you push your lane in the top, you win your lane, have your objectives under control, and see your <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bot lane duo</a> popping off. You breathe a sigh of relief because you think the game is already won, then you suddenly see a Vayne double kill; no big deal, you&#8217;re winning; that&#8217;s what matters. Then you see another Vayne kill announcement and another and another, and all of a sudden, their Vayne is killing your entire team. She has farmed her core items and is now snowballing her team to victory; what do you do? Is there a way to stop this? Is there a way to prevent this? Well, if you&#8217;re asking yourself that question, you are reading the right article because I will show you all the ways you can counter Vayne and prevent her <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-hyper-carries/" data-type="post" data-id="9744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyper-carry </a>late game. Read on as we study her skills and different champions and items to counter her.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Vayne&#8217;s Abilities</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Passive – Night Hunter –</strong> Every time she moves towards enemies, she gains a bonus movement speed, perfect for chasing down enemies and dodging skillshots.</li><li><strong>Q – Tumble – </strong>Vayne tumbles to a certain location. She then gains a bonus attack damage on her next basic attack. This is perfect for positioning and even dodging enemy spells cast on Vayne. She can also use this to chase enemy champions even faster.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>W –</strong> <strong>Silver Bolts</strong> – With every basic attack, Vayne puts this stack on the enemy champion. On the third stack or third hit on the same unit, Vayne deals true damage on the enemy depending on its max health. Attacking a different unit would transfer the stack instead of to that unit, and the stack would back to one. This works perfectly against champions with lots of armor.</li><li><strong>E </strong>– <strong>Condemn – </strong>Vayne can cast condemn on enemies, which will push them back. If the enemy hits a terrain when pushed, that champion is stunned for a certain duration, depending on Vayne&#8217;s level. Condemn also puts a stack of silver bolts on the enemy.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>R – Final Hour – </strong>With her ultimate skill, Vayne unsheathes her large crossbow on her back, and she gains bonuses on her skills. Vayne gains a flat amount of physical damage and also doubles the movement speed she gains from her passive. Every time Vayne uses a tumble, she becomes invisible, and the cooldown of her tumble is also greatly reduced.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>As you might hear from different videos or read from different articles, the best way to know your way around a champion is to play it yourself; that way, you can get familiarized with its strengths and weaknesses. This way, when playing against a Vayne, you&#8217;ll know when her vulnerable moments are, how to lane against her, and even different factors. Now let&#8217;s move on, knowing the champions to use against Vayne especially early game. Vayne&#8217;s early game is very weak so harassing her early game with ADC champions with long-range or junglers with high mobility is a great way to shut her off. So let&#8217;s take a look at the candidates.</p>

<h2><strong>Best Champions That Counter Vayne in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Ashe</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13532" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Vayne primarily loses to champions with very long ranges, and Ashe specializes just like that. She has a very long base attack range that has a passive that slows every enemy she hits with her basic attack. With this, you can easily win an early game matchup with Vayne by bullying her in the lane. Ashe also has her W ability which fires a volley of arrows that damages and slows enemies hit with it. Vayne would really have a hard time facing Ashe in the early game, even so in the late game when Ashe farms faster than Vayne</p>



<h3><strong>2. Lux / Caitlyn duo</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13534" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This bot lane composition has many ways to counter and kill vayne many items, be it early or late game. With Lux being aggressive support, she can zone Vayne out of the minion exp range. Lux can also cast her Q ability to root Vayne. Caitlyn can follow up on her W&#8217;s ability to further the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a>. The duo can burst her down with this. If Vayne manages to get away, both champions have very long-ranged ultimates, which they can both use to secure the kill on Vayne. This bot lane duo is very effective from early to late game.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Shadow Assassin Kayn</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="580" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-kayn-1024x580.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13533" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-kayn-1024x580.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-kayn-300x170.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-kayn-768x435.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-kayn-1536x870.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-kayn-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-kayn-150x85.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-kayn-750x425.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-kayn-1140x646.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Vayne is considered a glass cannon, which means in exchange for her very high damage output in the late game, she is squishy and easy to kill throughout the game. So it means she is very susceptible to assassinations of champions such as Kayn with very high burst potential. With Kayn, you can surprise Vayne wherever she is with your ability to walk through walls. Suppose you choose to be blue Kayn or shadow assassin Kayn. In that case, you can easily build lots of lethality items and literally one shot vayne with your basic combo and passive; if she manages to survive, you can cast your ultimate to finally finish her off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With all that in mind, these are just a few champions to counter Vayne; with this next section of the article, I will teach you the general counters for Vayne to figure out which champions counter her.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Best Tips On How To Play Against Vayne</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Outranging her would put her at a very huge disadvantage.</li><li>Build anti-heal items because Vayne uses lifesteal to make up for her squishy nature.</li><li>Burst champions like assassin mages and assassin junglers are champions made to counter glass cannons like Vayne</li><li>Champions with gap closers and crowd control abilities lock her down in one place.</li><li>Immediately using exhaust on Vayne just before a fight erupts is the perfect way to counter her, slowing her down and bringing her damage output down to 60%.</li><li>Constant harassment would prevent her from farming, thus shutting her out of the game.</li><li>Wave management to put her in a very susceptible position to ganks so you can repeatedly kill her.&nbsp;</li><li>Don&#8217;t pick champions with no gap closer against her as she would just run around and hit you, and you will never get to touch her.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Best Items to Counter Vayne in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Duskblade of Draktharr</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="592" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-1024x592.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13529" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-1024x592.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-300x173.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-768x444.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-150x87.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-750x433.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-1140x659.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This item is the best friend of almost all assassins. It deals bonus damage to champions that have not seen you in a while. Champions like Shaco can surprise Vayne with his burst damage along with Dark Harvest and Duskblade. With this item&#8217;s high damage and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/lethality-league-of-legends-how-does-it-work-updated/" data-type="post" data-id="7321" target="_blank">lethality</a> passive, you can surely burst Vayne before she can even do some damage to your team. Sometimes, the best defense is killing the enemy fast enough they won&#8217;t have time to react.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>2. Frozen Heart</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="577" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-1024x577.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13530" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-1024x577.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-768x433.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-150x85.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-750x423.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-1140x642.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart.jpg 1182w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This item is great for champions that rely on basic attacks and attack speed. Not only will this item slow Vayne&#8217;s attack speed down, but it would also help mitigate her very high damage output because of the large amount of armor it gives.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Thornmail&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="529" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-1024x529.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13531" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-1024x529.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-300x155.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-768x396.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-150x77.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-750x387.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-1140x588.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail.jpg 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The only way to counter Vayne&#8217;s damage is through building lots of armor and lots of health and sustain. With thorn mail, you can have both, and it&#8217;s passive that reflects damage, which is perfect because Vayne relies mostly on her basic attacks. This item also inflicts grievous wounds on champions that hit the wearer with a basic attack, also a great way to counter her lifesteal.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>After everything you have read, you should know how to stop a Vayne from <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-snowballing-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="10383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowballing</a> by now. After all, if a Vayne gets fed and is practically doing a 1v9, you lose the game unless your team focuses on locking her down with stuns and roots. Vayne deals a percentage of health, so tanks really aren&#8217;t that great against her too, so working as a team will always be the best way to counter her. After all, league of legends is a team game and should always be played to win more frequently. Thank you for reading and GLHF summoner; see you on the rift.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Master Yi is one of those champions that, if he really gets fed early, he will simply run down every lane and slaughter everyone on your team. If not, he can focus on power farming. You won’t see him gank any lane, but when he completes his core items, the same thing will happen he will simply end the game by always killing everyone on your team. Master Yi is a champion that has really high physical damage output, but he is not invincible. Despite having incredible damage, Master Yi lacks CC to stop his enemies. His only sustainability is his W which can be easily stopped with a stun or taunt or even silence.</p>



<p>Master Yi relies on his basic attacks and always needs to get near a champion to damage them. He has one gap closer, which is his alpha strike which is his main damage source. Master Yi can be daunting on lower ranks. Still, in <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/which-ranks-are-considered-as-high-elo-ones-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher elo</a>, he really doesn’t get played that often because people know how to easily counter him. Now that we’ve seen how e fairs in games, let’s study his skills so you can counter him even further.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Master Yi’s Abilities&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Passive – Double Strike – </strong>Each time master Yi strikes an opponent, he gains one stack of Double strikes. At 3 stacks, he strikes twice, the second strike being 50% weaker than the first one. This ability can critically strike a tower on the 2<sup>nd</sup> hit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Q –</strong> <strong>Alpha Strike – </strong>Master Yi vanishes and goes on alpha strike to damage 4 nearby enemies. He cannot be targeted; after a certain period, he reemerges and inflicts physical damage to enemies. Master Yi can use this ability to render certain skillshots useless or dodge a tower strike or any other damage when cast at the right time. This skill can also serve as a blink ability as Master Yi reemerges in front of his target.</li><li><strong>W –</strong> <strong>Meditate – </strong>Master Yi stops all of his actions to meditate. While meditating, he regenerates his health with a strength depending on how much health he is missing. He also gains damage reduction while meditating, and he can generate a stack of double strikes each second.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>E –</strong> <strong>Wuju Style – </strong>Master Yi can activate this skill to enhance his basic attacks making him deal true damage for each basic attack.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>R –</strong> <strong>Highlander – </strong>This ability gives Master Yi tremendous amounts of attack and movement speed when used. He also gains immunity to slows and cripples; if ever he is under the influence of slows, he can cast this skill to cleanse himself of all slows. This ability also provides a passive skill. Whenever Master Yi performs a takedown, he reduces all non-ultimate ability’s cooldown by 70%. This Is his initiating ability which also gives him Ghosting. This passive allows him to pass by units without obstruction.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Now you have the basic knowledge of how Master Yi works. Let’s look at the champions that counter him or team compositions that can shut him down completely.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Best Champions to Counter Master Yi in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Tryndamere</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13473" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Tryndamere is a champion that functions almost the same as Master Yi; he relies on basic attacks to take down enemies, a gap closer ability that also has damage, and a heal to sustain himself. They are pretty much the same, but the counter comes from his Ultimate skill. Tryndamere can trade hits with Master YI; as they both reach critical levels of HP, he gains the upper hand because his damage gets higher the lower his health is. He can cast his ultimate, which makes him immune to death for a few seconds. He also can out damage Master Yi because of his W ability which reduces the enemy’s physical damage output.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>2. Jax</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13472" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>With Jax, countering Master Yi is pretty simple. Let Master Yi cast his Alpha Strike on you. When he reemerges, cast your counter strike to render all his basic attacks useless; you can recast this ability to stun him. If ever Master Yi tries to get away from your E stun, you have a Q gap closer and chase him. It is also easy to beat Master Yi’s damage with Jax, a very strong late-game champion. Jax can also be used as a jungle champion that can easily counter jungle Master Yi and harass him in his own jungle camps.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Fiddlesticks</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13471" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>You can counter Master Yi with this champion as a jungler or even as a support. Master Yi’s weakness is when he can’t get near the enemy ADC or mages, which Fiddle can abuse. He has a fear ability that sends champions running away from Fiddle. Thanks to this ability, ADC’s and Mages can do their job to burst down Master Yi and basically win the entire game. Suppose you have the ability to <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-peel-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peel</a> Master Yi away from your enemies. In that case, he basically becomes useless throughout the game.</p>



<h2><strong>The Best Items For Countering Master Yi</strong></h2>



<p><strong><em>Everfrost</em></strong><em> – </em>this item can lock him down in one location, and mage champions can then burst him down or cast more crowd control abilities because CC’s are the main counter for Master Yi.</p>



<p><strong><em>Frozen Heart</em></strong><em> </em>– This item is very important to tank champions when facing against a Yi because of its passive that greatly reduces physical damage from enemy champions. With Master Yi being a champion that greatly relies on basic attacks, tanks can mitigate Yi’s great damage output.</p>



<p><strong><em>Zhonya’s Hourglass</em></strong><em> </em>– With this item, a champion can go into stasis which makes them invulnerable. This is great as it stalls Master Yi from bursting you down, and if he can’t perform, a takedown he won’t be able to reset his cooldowns. This item also provides the user a flat amount of armor which is always great against champions that deal physical damage.</p>

<h2><strong>How To Play Against Master Yi? The Best Tips:</strong></h2>



<p>Master Yi can be really easy to counter, just pick champions that have stuns or roots, and you’re good to go. But one <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC </a>ability<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a>is not enough to stop him from snowballing or killing your entire team in teamfights. A stun is Master Yi’s greatest weakness because he is a squishy champion. This glass cannon constantly needs peeling from his tanks or supports. Be careful in teamfights; you need to spot where Master Yi is because he comes into the fight after everyone has used their stuns, so reserve your <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC abilities</a> for him just in case he comes in late. </p>



<p>You can also harass him early game so that he doesn’t get to build his core items early and doesn’t snowball out of control. Assassins also work great against Master Yi like Shaco. With all this in mind, now you know that all it takes to defeat Master Yi is to lock him down with stuns or roots or basically kill him fast so that he doesn’t get the chance to kill you. Picking tank champions against him is not a robust counter because of his true damage ability that comes from his E ability, Wuju Style.</p>



<p> Now you know how to counter Master Yi, especially he has a high pick rate in lower elos. Go out there and win more games, GLHF summoner; see you on the rift.</p>

<p>Vex, the all-new champion that just got released in Season 11, was designed to completely shut down hypermobile champions dominating as of late, punishing every dash and flash that she sees in the field. Aside from that, she has the standard burst mage power that can delete every <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="8996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy champion</a> that her trusty companion, Shadow, would touch. If she kills someone after using her ultimate, she gets to recast it again, allowing her to <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-snowballing-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="10383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowball</a> a single kill into a pentakill. However, like every champion in the game, she can still be countered with the right tips and champions.</p>



<p>Before proceeding to detail how to counter the latest yordle on the Rift, let’s go on and understand her kit first.</p>



<h2><strong>Vex’s Abilities Explained</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Passive &#8211; Doom ‘n Gloom</strong> &#8211; The first part of her passive, Doom, periodically empowers her basic abilities to fear enemies that get hit. The second part of her passive marks nearby enemies who blink or dash with Gloom. Vex’s next basic attack and some of her basic abilities consume this mark to deal extra magic damage and refund Doom’s cooldown.</li><li><strong>Q &#8211; Mistral Bolt</strong> &#8211; Vex releases a wide wave of mist to the target direction that accelerates but reduces in width after a short while, dealing damage to all enemies hit. This ability consumes Gloom.</li><li><strong>W &#8211; Personal Space</strong> &#8211; Vex gains a shield and releases a shockwave around her, dealing damage. This ability consumes Gloom.</li><li><strong>E &#8211; Looming Darkness</strong> &#8211; Vex commands Shadow to the target location, slowing and dealing damage to enemies upon arrival.</li><li><strong>R &#8211; Shadow Surge</strong> &#8211; Vex commands Shadow to launch itself in the target direction, dealing damage to all enemies hit. Upon hitting a champion, the champion is marked with Gloom, and Vex can recast this ability to dash to that champion. If the marked champion dies within 12 seconds, Vex can recast Shadow Surge at no additional cost for the next 12 seconds.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Best Champions that Counter Vex in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Vladimir</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-vladimir-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13390" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-vladimir-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-vladimir-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-vladimir-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-vladimir-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-vladimir-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-vladimir-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-vladimir.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The resident vampire champion, Vladimir, is a great counter to the gloomy yordle. His abilities allow him to have some sustain to keep up with Vex’s poke and harass. His Sanguine Pool is also very crucial in helping him evade a good amount of Vex’s damage when she starts her combo. Come mid to late game, Vladimir’s burst damage is greater than Vex’s, and Vladimir becomes more of a bigger threat than Vex as he scales better. By focusing on teamfights, Vladimir easily gains an advantage over Vex.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Annie</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-annie-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13389" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-annie-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-annie-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-annie-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-annie-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-annie-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-annie-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-annie.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Annie is a burst mage that has a similar kit design to Vex. However, this little girl has shown to win out the match-up because Annie has a longer auto-attack range than Vex, allowing Annie to stay away from Vex, who mostly has short-range abilities, while poking her with Disintegrate. Annie also enjoys a certain level of mobility in the form of her Molten Shield, granting her movement speed that allows her to dodge Vex’s abilities easily. At level 6, Annie’s Summon: Tibbers is a lethal starter to her burst combo that she can perform in a safer range than Vex.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Xerath</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-xerath-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13391" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-xerath-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-xerath-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-xerath-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-xerath-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-xerath-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-xerath-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-counter-vex-xerath.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Another mage rounds up the Vex counters, this time coming from Shurima’s resident artillery mage, Xerath. As an artillery mage, Xerath has few to no problems poking Vex from a very safe distance. The immobile Vex will have a hard time dodging all the Arcanopulses and Eyes of Destruction that a competent Xerath will send toward the yordle’s way. If Vex decides to come up close, a Shocking Orb can stop her right away, then Xerath can again drop another barrage of harassing skillshots.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Beat Vex? Best Counter Tips</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Avoid staying near the minion wave. Vex has great waveclear with Mistral Bolt and Looming Darkness, so you need to force her to choose between clearing the wave or harassing you.</li><li>Never go into melee range against Vex. Her Personal Space provides her with a good shield, and if Doom-empowered, she can completely disrupt you and allow Vex to drop her full combo at you while you’re feared.</li><li>Consequently, try to bait out her Personal Space. Aside from losing a part of her damage, she also loses her only defensive ability, leaving her vulnerable.</li><li>At level 6, be on the lookout for Vex’s Looming Shadow. This skillshot is very long, and she can snipe you while you’re recalling.&nbsp;</li><li>As a burst mage, she scales better with items. Her combo is lethal if she drops it all together and even more lethal when she has her Mythic item. Keep tabs on your relative strength against her at all times.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Best Items to Counter Vex in Season 11</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Mercury’s Treads</strong> &#8211; This boot item can be underwhelming as an item that counters Vex, but the stats it gives, and its passive actually provides you with the right protection against Vex. With magic resistance and tenacity, you gain protection from both Vex’s damage and crowd control.</li><li><strong>Wit’s End</strong> &#8211; This item has been gaining popularity, especially among ADCs, providing both offense, defense, and utility all in one item. The magic resist is welcome to any champion planning to survive Vex’s burst, the passive can help you dodge her abilities, and the offensive stats give your champion more power to kill her.</li><li><strong>Edge of Night/Banshee’s Veil</strong> &#8211; These two items provide a similar and strong defensive passive to the two classes of champions, Edge of Night for AD champions and Banshee’s Veil for AP champions. Their passive gives you a spell-shield, nullifying a part of Vex’s combo and completely shutting down her pick potential.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Vex counters hypermobile champions and champions who happen to have just around the same HP as her. However, this does not make her completely undefeatable. Couple the tips we gave here in the guide with proper positioning, and Vex can become easier to handle, allowing you to stop her from doing what she does and stomping the game to a resounding victory.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Riven is pretty much the Yasuo of the top lane. Meaning when she is on your team, she will 0/10 herself before the 5-minute mark and proceed to go AFK for the rest of the match, leaving a fed Darius free to wreck you and the remainder of your team. On the other hand, if she is on the enemy team, she will single-handedly carry by dashing and jumping around and will hundred-to-zero everybody on your team. Yes, that includes your tank.</p>



<p>So how do you deal with this kind of champion? First off, we will need to look at her abilities to understand where all her damage is coming from and what you can do to stop her.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Passive</strong> &#8211; <strong>Runic Blade</strong> &#8211; Every time Riven casts an ability, she will gain a charge, stacking up to 3 times. Her basic attacks will use up a charge to deal bonus damage.</li><li><strong>Q</strong> &#8211; <strong>Broken Wings</strong> &#8211; A 3-part ability. The first two casts are dashes that cause damage, and the third is a leap that can go over terrain and knocks up units in a small area where she lands.</li><li><strong>W</strong> &#8211; <strong>Ki Burst</strong> &#8211; Riven emits a burst of energy around her in an area, damaging and stunning enemies hit.</li><li><strong>E</strong> &#8211; <strong>Valor</strong> &#8211; Dashes forward and gains a shield; this cannot go over terrain.</li><li><strong>R</strong> &#8211; <strong>Blade of the Exile</strong> &#8211; Riven empowers her sword, gaining AD, attack range, and extended range on her Q and W. She can recast this ability once.</li><li><strong>R(2)</strong> &#8211; <strong>Wind Slash</strong> &#8211; Riven fires a wave of energy in a cone, dealing damage scaling up with the target’s missing health. Damage maxes out at 75% missing health.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Best Champions That Counter Riven in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Garen</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-garen-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13328" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-garen-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-garen-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-garen-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-garen-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-garen-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-garen-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-garen.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Riven relies heavily on her abilities for damage output, meaning Garen’s Q, which has a silencing effect, will be a nightmare for her to deal with. Additionally, his W will not only directly shield him, but it also has a percentage damage reduction as well as a tenacity buff, meaning her W stun will be a lot shorter, provided Garen times it right. Garen will be able to win in the long run thanks to his passive which regenerates health and, even if he stacks armor to further lower Riven’s damage output, he is still very likely to kill her thanks to the armor shred on his E and the true damage from his ultimate.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Tryndamere</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-tryndamere-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13330" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-tryndamere-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-tryndamere-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-tryndamere-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-tryndamere-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-tryndamere-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-tryndamere-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-tryndamere.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Tryndamere has ridiculous damage output, which increases when he is lower on health. His W will reduce Riven’s AD for a short duration, meaning her whole combo will suffer, as everything, including her shield, scales off her Attack Damage. Lastly, Tryndamere’s ultimate makes him quite literally immortal for a short duration, so he can freely attack without worrying about dying.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Quinn</strong></h3>

<p>Few things bother Riven as much as a ranged matchup, but Quinn is even more annoying to deal with. Riven moving close to engage? Q her and she’s now nearsighted, can’t do much to you if she can’t see you. She somehow managed to get close to you? A quick E will put you at a safe distance again. Just make sure to poke her with your autos and passive occasionally, but do not waste your abilities if hers are up. If you misuse your E, she has a total of four dashes to get to you, which are usually more than enough, and you have no disengage tools to get her off you.</p>



<h3><strong>4. Urgot</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-urgot-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13331" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-urgot-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-urgot-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-urgot-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-urgot-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-urgot-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-urgot-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-champs-that-counter-riven-urgot.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Remember Riven did poorly against ranged matchups? Urgot is ranged AND tanky as well, which are both terrible news for her. Urgot has excellent DPS thanks to his passive and W, especially when it is fully leveled. He’s also capable of interrupting Riven’s combo by simply tossing her in the air with his E. When he reaches 6, his ult applies a slow based on missing health, making it near impossible for Riven to escape if she already used all her abilities.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Beat Riven? The Best Counter Tips:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Avoid fighting when all her abilities are up. Riven has both quick bursts of damage as well as decent damage over extended skirmishes.</li><li>She will want to land her full ability rotation while weaving in auto-attacks. Save any mobility you have to dodge her third Q, the knock-up, and don’t let her get passive procs off you; you will start feeling that damage coming through after the first two empowered basics she hits.</li><li>If she uses her abilities on the wave, especially her Q, that is your window to trade. Her bread and butter will be on cooldown, so her damage output will take a heavy hit.</li><li>If your champion can stick to her well, when she uses her E, wait the shield out before you continue trading, this will make sure the shield does not absorb any of the damage you deal, and it is all going through onto her actual HP.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>The Best Items to Counter Riven in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Dead Man’s Plate</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="514" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-dead-man-plate-1024x514.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13333" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-dead-man-plate-1024x514.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-dead-man-plate-300x151.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-dead-man-plate-768x385.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-dead-man-plate-150x75.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-dead-man-plate-360x180.jpg 360w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-dead-man-plate-750x376.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-dead-man-plate-1140x572.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-dead-man-plate.jpg 1188w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Dead Man’s Plate</strong> &#8211; Stacking armor is crucial against Riven; she only deals physical damage, after all. Dead Man’s has a decent amount of armor, plus the bonus move speed is a welcome aggregate if you need to chase or even flee.</p>



<h3><strong>Zhonya’s Hourglass</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="587" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-zhonya-hourglass-1024x587.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13335" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-zhonya-hourglass-1024x587.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-zhonya-hourglass-300x172.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-zhonya-hourglass-768x440.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-zhonya-hourglass-150x86.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-zhonya-hourglass-750x430.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-zhonya-hourglass-1140x654.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-zhonya-hourglass.jpg 1186w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Zhonya’s Hourglass</strong> &#8211; The AP alternative if you don’t want to sacrifice too much of your damage. The active Stasis effect is especially beneficial to avoid the execution damage from her ultimate recast.</p>



<h3><strong>Thornmail</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="523" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-thornmail-1024x523.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13334" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-thornmail-1024x523.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-thornmail-300x153.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-thornmail-768x392.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-thornmail-150x77.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-thornmail-750x383.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-thornmail-1140x583.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-thornmail.jpg 1182w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Thornmail</strong> &#8211; While Riven does not directly have any healing built into her kit, her builds usually feature Goredrinker or Eclipse as their mythic, followed by Death’s Dance and Sterak’s Gage, which all give substantial healing effects. Thornmail’s Grievous Wounds will counter that healing nicely.</p>



<h3><strong>Anathema’s Chains</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="446" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-anathema-chains-1024x446.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13332" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-anathema-chains-1024x446.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-anathema-chains-300x131.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-anathema-chains-768x335.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-anathema-chains-150x65.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-anathema-chains-750x327.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-anathema-chains-1140x497.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-riven-counter-items-anathema-chains.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Anathema’s Chains</strong> &#8211; A heavily underused item, designating Riven as your Nemesis will cause her to deal 30% less damage to you when at full stacks, plus a 20% reduction to Riven’s tenacity will come in handy if you’re playing a champion with <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard CC abilities</a>.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>While she might be scary with her insane mobility and high damage, Riven does have areas where she is vulnerable, just like any champion. Applying these tips to your gameplay will help you out when encountering The Exile in your lane. Best of luck out there in the Rift, Summoners!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Zed is one of those champions that you almost see every game in lower ranks. He often gets so fed, especially when your team consists of <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="8996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy champions</a>. His playstyle has improved so much ever since the implementation of mythic items; one basic example of this is his basic combo that deals so much damage when partnered with an early Eclipse Mythic.  So today, we will learn more about Zed&#8217;s kit, playstyle, item builds, and counter tips, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about some games where a Zed just runs around the map slaughtering everybody. </p>



<p>But before we start, think about this, playing a game of League of Legends is not just all about knowing how to play your champion, knowing how to kill your opponent, or just simply getting stronger through items or leveling; League of Legends is so much more than that. There are many factors to consider, like wave management, where you control the flow of minions so you can use it to push hard or to zone the enemy out of exp range or position the enemy near your turret so your jungler can easily gank your lane. Countering a champion with a certain champion is easy, but knowing how to counter a champion with anyone on the roster is the best way to play. So read on, and I&#8217;ll show you the best ways to counter Zed in season 11.</p>

<h2><strong>Zed&#8217;s Abilities</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Passive</strong> <strong>&#8211; Contempt for the Weak</strong> &#8211; Zed&#8217;s basic attack deals bonus magic damage against champions with low health. This is perfect when laning against squishy champions.</li><li><strong>Q &#8211; Razor Shuriken</strong> &#8211; Zed throws a shuriken that deals damage to enemies hit, which gets weaker after hitting the first unit. This is Zed&#8217;s most used ability; he can use it to poke or burst you down.</li><li><strong>W &#8211; Living Shadow</strong> &#8211; Zed can cast this ability which puts a shadow on a designated location, which can mimic Zeds abilities. He can recast this ability to switch places with the shadow; it also has a passive ability that restores Zed&#8217;s energy every time they hit a target together.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>E &#8211; Shadow Slash</strong> &#8211; Zed slashes the area around him; if his shadow hits the enemy with the E ability, the enemy unit is slowed for a short period.</li><li><strong>R &#8211; Death Mark</strong> &#8211; Zed becomes untargetable for a moment and dashes behind the enemy champion and leaves a death mark on them; after some time, the death mark triggers, repeating a portion of all the damage Zed has dealt with the enemy champion during the duration of the death mark.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>3 Best Champions to Counter Zed in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Kayle</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-kayle-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13209" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-kayle-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-kayle-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-kayle-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-kayle-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-kayle-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-kayle-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-kayle.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Zed is played primarily on mid-lane, so Kayle cannot really lane with him as she thrives in the top lane where she can farm in peace until the late game. Kayle counters Zed not in a way that you will kill him over and over again, so you&#8217;ll win the lane against him. The counter here depends on Kayle&#8217;s ultimate ability, which makes an allied target invulnerable for a short period and deals burst damage to surrounding enemies. Whenever you are in a fight, wait for the right moment before Zed uses his all-in combos on one of your carries; immediately cast your ult, so it shields them from Zed&#8217;s burst after he throws everything he is basically useless until his skills come out of cooldown and his energy gets back up.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Orianna</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-orianna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13210" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-orianna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-orianna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-orianna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-orianna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-orianna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-orianna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-orianna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Now here is a champion that can bully him in the mid lane. Zed relies on his basic attacks and Q ability to farm minions in the lane; with Orianna, you can easily zone him out of minion range with your ball placement along with its burst damage from your W. You can continue zoning him out, so he does not <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-snowballing-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="10383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowball</a> and burst you down in one trade. As Oriana, you might be a little squishy when facing Zed, so rushing an <strong>Hourglass</strong> or a <strong>Stopwatch</strong> is very important. Oriana also has a shield ability which she can use to mitigate Zed&#8217;s Q poke.  </p>



<h3><strong>3. Ekko</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-ekko-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13208" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-ekko-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-ekko-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-ekko-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-ekko-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-ekko-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-ekko-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-zed-counters-ekko.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>One of Zed&#8217;s best counters is also an assassin. Thanks to his E ability, Ekko can easily counter Zed&#8217;s mobility skill; he also can out damage Zed in the lane as Zed is also a squishy champion. So the counter goes like this during the laning phase, bait out Zed&#8217;s W ability, so he is vulnerable; after his W is down, you can initiate a trade with him and continue doing this until you get Zed low enough to eventually win yourself the lane against him. If Zed proceeds to try and go with his all-in combo, you can just use your ult to get out of harm&#8217;s way or use it to heal all the damage he&#8217;s don&#8217;t to you back.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How to Beat Zed in Season 11?</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Pick champions with great sustainability so that he won&#8217;t be able to burst you down in 2 or 3 trades. After a trade, it is great for you to have a lifesteal or heal to get your health back up.</li><li>Use champions with lots of crowd control abilities.</li><li>Avoid going on 1v1 against him when he&#8217;s already built his core items or mythic item.&nbsp;</li><li>Make sure that his W is down before going in a trade against him.</li><li>During the early game, pay attention to his level. He can surprise you with an unexpected all-out combo when he hits level 6.</li><li>Try sidestepping his shurikens, as this would hurt if 2 or 3 hits you at once.</li><li>If you are squishy, you should rush buying a stopwatch or Zhonya&#8217;s Hourglass.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Best Items to Counter Zed in Season 11</strong></p>



<h3><strong>1. Stopwatch / Zhonya&#8217;s Hourglass</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="596" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-zed-zhonya-hourglass-1024x596.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13207" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-zed-zhonya-hourglass-1024x596.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-zed-zhonya-hourglass-300x175.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-zed-zhonya-hourglass-768x447.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-zed-zhonya-hourglass-150x87.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-zed-zhonya-hourglass-750x437.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-zed-zhonya-hourglass-1140x664.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-zed-zhonya-hourglass.jpg 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Playing a squishy champion against Zed can be challenging, so building an early <strong>Zhonya</strong> would counter Zed so hard. It gives you 45 armor and a huge 65 ability power upgrade. It also has the active ability to put you in stasis, making you untargetable for the next 2.5 seconds. But be careful when using it as it takes away your ability to move at all, which can give Zed an advantage instead if wrongly used.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>2. Immortal Shieldbow</strong></h3>

<p>Ah yes, season 11&#8217;s Mythic item that almost all assassins hate. This item gives you a shield when you fall below a certain health percentage and gives you an extra passive ability of enhanced lifesteal you can use to make your health come back up just before the pop of Zed&#8217;s ultimate comes. If you didn&#8217;t manage to lifesteal your health back, don&#8217;t worry because the shield will handle Zed&#8217;s death mark damage.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Zed might be a scary champion to play against but given enough <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a> and sustainability; your team can completely shut him out of the game as he falls behind in dealing damage and burst potential. Once stunned or rooted, Zed becomes very vulnerable for your team to take him out. Remember, any champion can play against any champion; there is no such thing as counterplay if you learn the game&#8217;s most important features. Thanks for reading; now you can confidently lane against Zed and win more games, GLHF summoner, see you in the Rift!</p>

<p>So you&#8217;ve come here because you lost a game against Tryndamere; let me guess, he was left alone to farm and accumulated his core items and just started demolishing your carries which eventually led the game to spin out of control and made you lose the game? If so, I got you; in this article, I will show you how to counter Tryndamere and play any game against him and come out on top. But before anything else, let&#8217;s take a moment and learn Tryndamere&#8217;s kit and the things that make him such a solid late-game champion.</p>



<h2><strong>Tryndamere&#8217;s Abilities</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Passive – Battle Fury –</strong> Every time Tryndamere hits a unit, kills a unit, or inflicts a critical strike, he builds upon his fury; the higher his fury, the more crit chance he has.</li><li><strong>Q – Bloodlust – </strong>Tryndamere gets stronger the lower his health drops; this ability can also be activated, making tryndamere consume all his fury pool and heal him. Higher fury gives tryndamere stronger heals</li><li><strong>W –</strong> <strong>Mocking Shout</strong> – This can be activated to reduce a nearby enemy&#8217;s attack damage; it also slows enemies facing away from tryndamere.</li><li><strong>E </strong>– <strong>Spinning Slash – </strong>This is his main gap closer ability; he spins his sword and moves to a specific location. It also has damage that grows along with Tryndamere&#8217;s attack damage.</li><li><strong>R – Undying Rage – </strong>His ultimate ability prevents Tryndamere&#8217;s health from dropping to zero.</li></ul>



<p>Well, of course, you didn&#8217;t come here to get to know these things, so now let&#8217;s get to the &#8220;how to counter Tryndamere&#8221; part. Tryndamere is a strong melee champion who relies solely on his basic attacks. He has a substantial gap closer that has relatively significant damage and has a cooldown that can be reduced every time he hits a crit. With the addition of Mythic items, he can build the Galeforce, giving him more gap closer, making it harder for you to chase him or get away from him. With all that in mind, let us now take a look at the champions that have the potential to counter him. </p>

<h2><strong>The Best Champions to Counter Tryndamere in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Jax</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-jax-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13160" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-jax-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-jax-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-jax-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-jax-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-jax-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-jax-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-jax.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Tryndamere, a champion reliant on basic attacks would be easily countered by Jax&#8217;s E ability counter strike. As Jax, you can lane against Tryndamere aggressively in the early laning phase, level up your W as your first ability, and out damage him. You can bully him out of minion exp range, so he&#8217;ll fall behind early and deny him of gold he badly needs because his power spike relies on items. As you hit level 2, you can even further your lead against him by leveling your E, completely stomping his lane. Continue zoning him out, and if his jungler comes to gank, you can just back and wait for the enemy jungler to back off and rinse repeat the aforementioned laning phase strategy until you snowball and win the game.</p>



<p><strong><em>Jax early game items to counter Tryndamere:</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Bramble Vest – </strong>An item that gives a substantial amount of armor and gives your attacker grievous wounds, a great way to counter Tryndamere&#8217;s heavy hits and reduce heals from his Q ability. This will make for a great first item.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Plated Steel Caps – </strong>Boot upgrade that reduces oncoming basic attack damage by 12%. This is a great way to mitigate Tryndamere&#8217;s damage. </p>



<h3><strong>2. Malphite</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-malphite-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13161" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-malphite-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-malphite-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-malphite-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-malphite-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-malphite-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-malphite-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-malphite.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Malphite is one of those champions who can stack up so much armor that your physical damage would make him feel like he&#8217;s being tickled. He has a Q ability that is great to run away from Tryndamere as it not only slows down its target but also speeds Malphite up for a substantial amount. You can max out his W to raise his armor percentage growth and completely deny Tryndamere&#8217;s damage, and if Tryndamere happens to get close and hit you, you can use your E to slow his attack speed down, so Tryndamere can&#8217;t do anything against you. During the early game, you need to play safe because he can bully you out of your lane, but when you build your core items, you will barely feel Tryndamere&#8217;s damage against you.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Malphite early game items to counter Tryndamere:</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Bramble vest – </strong>goes well with your stats and denies Tryndamere&#8217;s massive heal with his bloodlust.</p>



<p><strong>Glacial buckler – </strong>Gives you mana to harass Tryndamere with your q and a great item that can be built into a frozen heart later on.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Quinn</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-quinn-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13162" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-quinn-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-quinn-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-quinn-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-quinn-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-quinn-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-quinn-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-champions-to-counter-tryndamere-quinn.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Not only will you outrange him, downright bullying him out of the lane, but also use your E ability to keep your distance from him and continue basic attacking him. Quinn&#8217;s ultimate is great for returning to lanes or roaming other lanes and giving your team further lead against opponents. Unlike other champions, there isn&#8217;t a specific item to counter Tryndamere with Quinn; you can build any of Quinn&#8217;s core items and still stomp Tryndamere during the laning phase.</p>

<h2><strong>The Best Items to Counter Tryndamere in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Frozen Heart</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="583" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-frozen-heart-1024x583.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13164" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-frozen-heart-1024x583.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-frozen-heart-300x171.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-frozen-heart-768x437.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-frozen-heart-150x85.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-frozen-heart-750x427.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-frozen-heart-1140x649.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-frozen-heart.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>If you are playing a tank champion, the Frozen heart is a great item to build against Tryndamere. It gives a tremendous amount of armor, and with season 11&#8217;s item updates, it now reduces incoming basic attack damage by a flat amount and is increased by 3.5 for every 1000 bonus health you have.</p>



<h3><strong>Randuin&#8217;s Omen</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="601" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-randuin-omen-1024x601.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13165" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-randuin-omen-1024x601.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-randuin-omen-300x176.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-randuin-omen-768x451.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-randuin-omen-150x88.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-randuin-omen-750x440.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-randuin-omen-1140x669.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-randuin-omen.jpg 1172w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>A classic item to counter champions that rely on critical hits. Tryndamere builds up crit chance with every hit or kills or crit he does, so building this item would significantly reduce Tryndamere&#8217;s damage. It also has an active effect that can be used to slow nearby enemies, a great way to get away from him if he uses his e ability to get close to you.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Executioner’s Calling / Bramble Vest / Oblivion Orb items</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="287" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-executioners-calling-1024x287.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13163" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-executioners-calling-1024x287.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-executioners-calling-300x84.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-executioners-calling-768x215.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-executioners-calling-150x42.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-executioners-calling-750x210.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-executioners-calling-1140x320.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/best-items-to-counter-trynda-executioners-calling.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Basically, every item that inflicts grievous wounds on opponents. As we all know, Tryndamere builds lifesteal items to improve his already impressive lane survivability, so building Grievous wound items would greatly reduce Tryndamere&#8217;s heals, as one of his core items this season the Goredrinker gives him so much healing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>I know watching those Tryndamere montages where he slaps everyone with his sword and takes their health bars down to a quarter seems daunting when you are in a game against him. Still, with everything that I just mentioned above, by now, you should know how to deal with his damage and completely deny him out of the game. Just learn when to play aggressively or defensively; after all, every win comes down with how you play the game, and the game has an infinite number of ways to be played depending on the situation. So no matter what you read, it all comes down with how you read your opponent&#8217;s mind and counter how they play; if you think like this, then there would be no such thing as a counter champion, and you can reach an even higher rank you&#8217;ve only dreamed of once. So get out there and play with all these in mind, GLHF Summoner; see you on the rift.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Illaoi, “The Kraken Priestess”, has been one of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-off-meta-top-laners/" data-type="post" data-id="8821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most powerful top lane champions</a> throughout Season 11 of League of Legends. Even though she lacks mobility, her enormous damage potential makes you forget about it. Illaoi has a tremendous 1v2/3/4/5 potential and can easily solo carry her games. She pretty much counters most tanks in the game, and people on social media have named her the “Tank Destroyer”. Even though she is very powerful, she does have a lot of weaknesses. Illaoi lacks any viable <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>, and if you manage to shut her down in the early game, she will have a hard time getting back in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Illaoi is a mana-hungry champion, so if you abuse her in the early game, she’ll have no other option than to retreat under her tower. She also doesn’t do very well against ranged or high-mobility champions because they can easily dodge her E and kill her tentacles from a safe distance. When you’re laning against Illaoi, the most important thing you’ll need to do is to control the minion waves. Now that we&#8217;ve covered some basic tips on how to counter Illaoi, let&#8217;s have a look at her abilities to give you a better understanding of how to play against her.</p>



<h2><strong>Illaoi&#8217;s Abilities</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Passive</strong>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Prophet of an Elder God</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Every 20 seconds Illaoi will spawn a tentacle near her. These tentacles will attack enemies if&nbsp;<strong>Harsh Lesson</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Test of Spirit</strong>&nbsp;is used. Illaoi will heal for 5% of her missing health for each Tentacle that hits an enemy champion.</li><li><strong>Q</strong>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Tentacle Smash</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Once it’s activated, Illaoi will slam down a tentacle in the given direction.</li><li><strong>W</strong>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Harsh Lesson</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Harsh Lesson empowers Illaoi with a 225 bonus range and causes her to leap to the target’s location. This attack will also deal bonus physical damage and will force all&nbsp;<strong>Tentacles</strong>&nbsp;in the range to attack the target.</li><li><strong>E</strong>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Test of Spirit&nbsp;</strong>&#8211; Once Illaoi casts this ability, she will throw a&nbsp;<strong>Spirit</strong>&nbsp;in a straight line, and if landed, Illaoi will connect with a champion and pull the&nbsp;<strong>Spirit</strong>&nbsp;from their body in front of her. This&nbsp;<strong>Spirit</strong>&nbsp;stays still, has a health bar, and is tethered to the enemy champion whose&nbsp;<strong>Spirit</strong>&nbsp;was pulled. This&nbsp;<strong>Spirit</strong>&nbsp;will also have a radius, and if the enemy champion leaves that radius, the&nbsp;<strong>Spirit</strong>&nbsp;will be pulled back into them, which will slow them and turn them into a&nbsp;<strong>Vessel</strong>&nbsp;for 10 seconds. Enemies that have been hit by this ability will also spawn&nbsp;<strong>Tentacles</strong>&nbsp;near themselves every 5/4/3 (based on level) seconds. Each&nbsp;<strong>Tentacle</strong>&nbsp;will autonomously attack the closest&nbsp;<strong>Vessel</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Spirit</strong>.</li><li><strong>R</strong>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Leap of Faith &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>Once Illaoi casts her ultimate, she leaps into the air and then slams into the ground, dealing physical damage to the surrounding enemies. She will also summon one Tentacle per each enemy champion hit. Her Tentacles cannot be killed during her ultimate, and her W ability will have a 50% CDR on it.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Best Champions That Counter Illaoi in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Heimerdinger</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-heimerdinger-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11605" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-heimerdinger-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-heimerdinger-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-heimerdinger-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-heimerdinger-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-heimerdinger-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-heimerdinger.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>Thanks to Heimer’s turrets, he can easily shove Illaoi under her tower, which will force her to miss a lot of CS. Heimerdinger can also hide behind his tower to easily avoid getting hit by her E. Illaoi doesn’t bring any CC to the table, which means that Heimerdinger can survive getting ganked by the enemy jungler. It’s crucial to build health reduction items on Heimerdinger to counter Illaoi, so we recommend you to rush Liandry’s Anguish, alongside with Demonic’s Embrace and Morellonomicon. This should be enough to help you beat her.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>2. Mordekaiser</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-mordekaiser-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11606" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-mordekaiser-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-mordekaiser-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-mordekaiser-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-mordekaiser-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-mordekaiser-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-mordekaiser.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>Mordekaiser is probably Illaoi’s biggest counter because he can isolate Illaoi from her Tentacles with his R (ultimate). Avoid playing aggressively and fighting her before you get to level 6. Once you reach level 6, just wait for her to use her ultimate and then use yours because once you do that, you will remove all of her Tentacles and take her to your world. A world in which you’re the boss.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>3. Urgot</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-urgot-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11607" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-urgot-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-urgot-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-urgot-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-urgot-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-urgot-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/illaoi-counters-urgot.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<ul><li>Urgot is one of the toughest matchups for Illaoi. Since she eats a lot of damage during her ultimate, she gets extremely low on her health, which is more than enough for Urgot to execute her with his ultimate before she can kill him. Urgot’s shield also lets him dodge Illaoi’s Q or E abilities. All you have to do with Urgot is to play aggressively and force her to make mistakes.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>How to Lane Against Illaoi?</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Illaoi is very weak in the early game, so you should always abuse Illaoi before she gets to level 3. Once she gets to level 3, all you have to do is to keep killing her&nbsp;<strong>Tentacles</strong>&nbsp;and keep dodging her&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>. I know it sounds easy, but trust me when I tell you this, sometimes it’s really not. If you don’t know how to play any of the 3 biggest Illaoi counters we’ve mentioned before in the article (<strong>Mordekaiser</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Heimerdinger</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Urgort</strong>), try playing some ranged champions. Ranged champions can poke her out and get the advantage through tower plates.</li><li>Healing reduction items can truly hurt Illaoi. So, if you’re playing a tank, make sure to rush&nbsp;<strong>Bramble West</strong>, and if you’re playing a fighter or an assassin champion, make sure to rush&nbsp;<strong>Executioner’s Calling</strong>&nbsp;(for AD champions) or&nbsp;<strong>Oblivion Orb</strong>&nbsp;(for AP champions).&nbsp;</li><li>Since her E is her most important ability, be sure to always bait it out as the first play. If she manages to land her E, she will most likely kill you and your jungler.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>How to Counter Illaoi? Best Tips:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Always try to dodge her E. If she manages to land it, make sure to get out of its zone as soon as possible (this will stop her <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AoE</a> from hitting you multiple times).</li><li>Illaoi has a lack of mobility, so when you’re laning against her, make sure to pick champions with high movement speed or mobility.</li><li>Make sure to avoid standing close to her tentacles because she can always hurt you really bad with it once she uses her W (plus, she will also receive a slight heal if her tentacles damage you)</li><li>Be careful when you’re recalling when you’re cursed (her E) because there’s a high chance that her tentacles will find you and will kill you. Make sure to kill 3 tentacles in order to remove the curse.</li><li>Do your best to bait her E, and if you manage to dodge it, you should go in and try to fight her.</li><li>Do not group up around Illaoi, especially in team fights, just poke her down and kite her.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Even though she is <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/10-least-played-champions-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9125" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a very popular champion</a>, Illaoi has always been a very strong pick ever since she was released. If you follow the tips we&#8217;ve told you in this guide, there&#8217;s a high chance that you&#8217;ll demolish Illaoi most of the time. Just remember to play it safe and use the advantage of her weak early game. I wish you the best of luck in the fields of justice, Summoner!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/trundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trundle</a> is one of those <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-hyper-carries/" data-type="post" data-id="9744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OP champions</a> that’s a nightmare to be playing against. This champion is a pure monster, he deals a lot of damage, he heals a lot, and he has an incredibly fast movement speed. If you pick a tanky champion, he’ll just steal your stats and beat you down with his life steal. On the other hand, if you decide to pick a squishy champion, he’ll just run and hunt you down. So, now you’re probably asking yourself: “<em>Well, how do I beat this unstoppable answer?! He seems invincible!</em>”. Don’t worry because I’ll tell you all about his weaknesses and how to counter Trundle in this quick and easy-to-follow guide! But, before I do, let&#8217;s have a look at his abilities to give you a better understanding of what things you should avoid doing when you&#8217;re facing him in your ranked games.</p>



<h2><strong>Trundle&#8217;s Abilities</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Passive</strong>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>King&#8217;s Tribute</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Whenever an enemy unit dies near him, Trundle heals for a percentage of its maximum Health</li><li><strong>Q</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong>Chomp</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Once activated, Trundle bites his opponent, deals extra damage, steals some of their Attack Damage, and slows them.</li><li><strong>W</strong>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Frozen Domain</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Trundle turns the target location into a zone where he gains attack speed, movement speed, and increased healing from all enemies inside the zone.</li><li><strong>E</strong>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Pillar of Ice</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Trundle spawns an ice pillar at the target location, slowing all enemies around its location.</li><li><strong>R</strong>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Subjugate</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Trundle starts dealing magic damage to the enemy champion, and he heals for the amount of damage dealt. Trundle also steals a percentage of his target’s defensive stats.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Best Champions That Counter Trundle in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h2><strong>Camille</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-camille-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11628" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-camille-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-camille-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-camille-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-camille-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-camille-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-camille.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Camille is one of the worst matchups for Trundle because she’s able to deal massive amounts of true damage, which hurts Trundle really bad. Camille overall does a great job in beating Trundle overall, but she can outdamage her in short trades in the early game if he doesn’t allow Camille to get her 2nd proc of Q. However, if you do decide to pick Camille against Trundle, be careful when you’re using your wall dash, as he can stop it with his Pillar of Ice ability.</p>



<h2><strong>Darius</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-darius-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11629" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-darius-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-darius-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-darius-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-darius-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-darius-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/trundle-counters-darius.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This is a pretty hard matchup for Trundle because Darius’s passive (Hermorrahge) stops Trundle from healing, and if Trundle doesn’t manage to dodge Darius’s Q (Decimate), he’s in big trouble. When you’re playing Darius against Trundle, you should always use your W (Crippling Strike) before using Q (Decimate) because that way, he won’t be able to dodge it as he’’ll be slowed. He doesn’t stand a chance against Darius in short trades in the early game because Darius can quickly proc his passive with E (Apprehend) + Basic Attack + W (Crippling Strike) and Q (Decimate) combo.</p>



<h2><strong>Fiora</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-beat-trundle-fiora-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11626" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-beat-trundle-fiora-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-beat-trundle-fiora-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-beat-trundle-fiora-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-beat-trundle-fiora-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-beat-trundle-fiora-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/how-to-beat-trundle-fiora.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Thanks to her true damage and her W (Riposte) ability which can block some of his abilities, Fiora is one of Trundle’s biggest counters in Season 11 of League of Legends. A good Trundle player will always try to bait it out, so make sure not to get tricked by his baits because if you fail to land it, there’s a high chance that you’ll lose the trade. When you’re playing Fiora, your main objective when trading with Trundle will be to hit those vital points (Passive) in order to win the trades.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Beat Trundle? Best Counter Tips:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Buy healing reduction items to counter Trundle’s healing from his passive and ultimate.</li><li>Always make sure to move out of his Frozen Domain during a fight because it gives him massive amounts of movement speed, attack speed, and healing.</li><li>If you’re playing a champion that has dashing abilities, save them to dash over his Pillar.</li><li>Avoid long fights with Trundle because of his healing. Just do short trades because he’s not able to deal massive amounts of damage in short periods of time.</li><li>Avoid fighting against him alone if he’s already ahead.</li><li>Be careful when he hits level 6 because he can bait you with his ultimate when he’s low on HP.</li><li>Trundle is weak against champions with CC, use them to your advantage.</li><li>Use champions with high mobility so you can get out of his Frozen Domain faster.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Also read: <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/garen-vs-darius" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Garen vs Darius &#8211; The Best Counter Build &#8211; How to beat Darius with Garen</a></strong></p>



<h2><strong>Best Items to Counter Trundle in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Executioner&#8217;s Calling</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re playing an AD champion, you should always rush Executioner’s Calling because it seriously counters Trundle and his healing abilities. This item counters Trundle’s passive, W (Frozen Domain), and R (Subjugate) and will be of great help to you when you trade with him in the lane. Executioner&#8217;s Calling costs only 800 gold, so it&#8217;s a very cheap item to grab in the early game.</p>



<h3><strong>Morellonomicon</strong></h3>



<p>If you&#8217;re playing an AP champion, you should always rush Oblivion Orb (later upgraded to Morellonomicon) because it does the same job as Executioner&#8217;s Calling. This item also counters Trundle&#8217;s passive, W (Frozen Domain), and R (Subjugate) and will be of great help to you when you trade with him in the lane. Just like Executioner&#8217;s Calling, the cost of Oblivion Orb is also only 800 gold, which means that you can easily buy it in the early game.</p>



<h3><strong>Blade of the Ruined King</strong></h3>



<p>Blade of the Ruined King is an extremely important item to grab if you’re playing squishy champions. BotRK’s passive, Mist’s Edge, deals bonus physical damage on hit, and it&#8217;s other passive, Siphone, empowers your basic attacks with stacks, stacking up to 3 times. The third stack consumes all stacks to deal 40-150 bonus magic damage on-hit and also slows the enemy target by 25% for 2 seconds while also granting you 25% movement speed. This extra movement speed will significantly help you against Trundle, especially if you’re using a low mobility champion.</p>



<h2><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>I know that beating Trundle seems like an impossible task, but don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s possible, especially if you follow the tips from our guide. So there you have it, our counter Trundle guide in Season 11! We wish you the best of luck on the fields of justice, Summoner!

<p>Even though it doesn&#8217;t seem like it, the little devil (Teemo) is one of Darius&#8217; biggest counters on the top lane, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he can always win against Darius. If you’ve been playing League for some time, you have probably noticed that this particular champ matchup is one of the most common ones in the game (in both the high and low elo). Did you know that Teemo encounters Darius in almost 67% of his ranked games? Not only does Teemo encounter Darius very often, with a tremendous&nbsp;<strong>53.0% win rate</strong>, he also does a great job in beating him. If you&#8217;re a Teemo main, or are just struggling to play him against Darius, then continue reading this guide as I&#8217;ll share some easy-to-follow tips on how to always beat Darius with Teemo!</p>

<h2><strong>Best Teemo Items to Counter Darius in Season 11</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="574" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-teemo-items-to-counter-darius-1024x574.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11564" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-teemo-items-to-counter-darius-1024x574.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-teemo-items-to-counter-darius-300x168.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-teemo-items-to-counter-darius-768x430.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-teemo-items-to-counter-darius-1536x861.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-teemo-items-to-counter-darius-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-teemo-items-to-counter-darius-750x420.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/best-teemo-items-to-counter-darius-1140x639.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>When you&#8217;re facing Darius with Teemo, the most important thing for you will be not to let him pull or catch you. If he does that, you&#8217;re basically dead. In most cases, you&#8217;d be rushing&nbsp;<strong>Liandry&#8217;s Anguish</strong>, but that&#8217;s not the case when you&#8217;re facing Darius. I truly recommend you to rush&nbsp;<strong>Cosmic Drive</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Boots</strong>&nbsp;because that, combined with your W ability and&nbsp;<strong>Phase Rush</strong>&nbsp;rune, will allow you to outrun Darius. Once you&#8217;ve bought&nbsp;<strong>Cosmic Drive</strong>, you should rush&nbsp;<strong>Liandry&#8217;s Anguish</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Demonic Embrace</strong>. Once you get these two items, your mushrooms will basically melt your opponents.

<p>When it comes to runes, there isn&#8217;t a better choice than&nbsp;<strong>Phase Rush</strong>. Since Teemo can easily proc this rune, you&#8217;ll have no issues with escaping Darius&#8217;s pull (Apprehend). Also, if you manage to dodge his pull successfully, you can easily kite him and force him to go under his tower.&nbsp;<strong>Manaflow Band</strong>&nbsp;is useful for mana sustain in the early game, and you can proc it with your basic attacks. On the third line of the rune page, you should always go for&nbsp;<strong>Absolute Focus</strong>&nbsp;because it will allow you to deal more damage when you trade with Darius. On the fourth line of the rune page, you&#8217;ll have two options,&nbsp;<strong>Scorch</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Gathering Storm</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Schorch</strong>&nbsp;is better for your laning phase, and&nbsp;<strong>Gathering Storm</strong>&nbsp;is better if you think you&#8217;ll need to have a stronger late game. On your 2nd rune tree, you should always go for&nbsp;<strong>Cheap Shot</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Counter Darius With Teemo? Best Tips:</strong></h2>



<ol><li>Your main objective is to dodge Darius&#8217;s E (Apprehend). Once you do that, you&#8217;ll be able to kite him easily, and he will have no other choice than to retreat under his tower.</li><li>When you&#8217;re running away from Darius, you will need to try to stay out of his Q as it will give him 5% movement speed and extra damage, which in most cases will result in him killing you.</li><li>Be careful of his passive, Hemorrhage. Once he reaches five stacks, his ultimate, Noxian Guillotine, will deal double true damage.&nbsp;</li><li>If you are behind, you should get Mercurial Scimitar because magic resist weakens his passive, and Mercury&#8217;s active gets rid of his slow + grants you 50% movement speed for one second.</li></ol>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Even though this is a hard matchup, a good Teemo player should always be able to defeat Darius, at least in the early game. If you&#8217;re struggling to play against Darius, you should just retreat under your tower and last hit minions and wait for your jungler to come and give you a helping hand. Remember to be extra careful in the early game because if you fall behind with Teemo, it can be quite tricky to make a comeback. I wish you the best of luck on the Summoner&#8217;s Rift!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been playing LeBlanc for some time now, you&#8217;ve probably seen that a lot of your opponents like to pick Fizz against her because they think he counters her. He does counter her in most cases, however, if you play your cards right, you&#8217;ll be able to beat him without any problem. Your main task in the early game will be to deny his farm, so you&#8217;ll need to either freeze minion waves under your tower and do quick trades with him. Since most Fizz players usually rush&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Corrupting_Potion" target="_blank">Corrupting Potion</a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Scorch</strong>&nbsp;rune, and&nbsp;<strong>Ignite</strong>, keep in mind that he can easily outdamage you on levels 3 and 4, so make sure to use your&nbsp;<strong>W (Distortion)</strong>&nbsp;wisely because you&#8217;ll need it in order to escape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every single Fizz main will always try to dodge your W by using his&nbsp;<strong>Q+W</strong>&nbsp;dash combo, so do not try to use the standard&nbsp;<strong>Q+W combo</strong>&nbsp;against him. He can dodge your&nbsp;<strong>Q+W</strong>&nbsp;combo in 2 different ways, the first way is by using his&nbsp;<strong>Q+W</strong>&nbsp;dash combo, and the 2 one is by simply using his&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>&nbsp;ability. If he dodges your W damage, you&#8217;re going to be very vulnerable because you&#8217;ll lose your only advantage you have over him, and that&#8217;s mobility. In that case, if Fizz ults you, try to be near your tower because he won&#8217;t be able to finish you off thanks to your <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/leblanc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passive</a> because you will become invisible for 1 second when you drop below 40% damage.</p>



<p><em>So, how do you trade with him then?</em>&nbsp;Allow me to explain:</p>



<p>When you&#8217;re trying to trade with Fizz, you need to bait either his&nbsp;<strong>Q</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>&nbsp;ability, and once you do that, you&#8217;ll have the advantage over him. Since Fizz is a melee champion, you can harass him with your basic attacks without taking any damage in return. Since we know that he can dodge LeBlanc&#8217;s&nbsp;<strong>W</strong>&nbsp;damage, you can attack him with basic attacks and Q (<strong>Sigil of Malice</strong>) in order to proc the&nbsp;<strong>Electrocute</strong>. This will hurt Fizz badly in the early game, so he&#8217;ll need to use all of his&nbsp;<strong>Corrupting Potions</strong>, which means that he won&#8217;t be able to deal the extra damage from&nbsp;<strong>Corrupting Potion&#8217;s</strong>&nbsp;passive. The other way you can trade with Fizz is by landing your E first. If you manage to land your chain on him, he won&#8217;t be able to use his&nbsp;<strong>Q</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>, which means that you can throw your&nbsp;<strong>Q+W</strong>&nbsp;combo without worrying that he&#8217;s going to dodge it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best LeBlanc combo vs. Fizz after level 6 would be&nbsp;<strong>E (Ethereal Chains) +R (Ethereal Chains Mimic) + Q (Sigil of Malice) + W (Distortion).&nbsp;</strong>If you think that you need even more CC, you should get&nbsp;<strong>Everfrost</strong>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<strong>Luden&#8217;s Tempest.&nbsp;</strong>This combo will completely immobilize Fizz, which means that you&#8217;ll be able to kill him without taking any damage in return.</p>

<p>This is the standard build for LeBlanc in most of the matchups, however, like we said earlier in this guide, if you think that you need more CC, you should consider getting&nbsp;<strong>Everfrost</strong>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<strong>Luden’s Tempest</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Everfrost’s</strong>&nbsp;unique active, Glaciate, will deal 100 (+30% AP) magic damage in the target direction and will slow the enemies by 65% for 1.5 seconds will provide you with, while also rooting them for the same duration. This root will be of great help to you when trading with Fizz because he won&#8217;t be able to use his abilities while he&#8217;s under that effect.</p>

<p>Electrocute is, without a doubt, the best rune choice for LeBlanc in most matchups, and it’s the same case when you’re playing against Fizz. LeBlanc can quickly proc the&nbsp;<strong>Electrocute</strong>, which will allow you to deal extra damage in the early game. The best way to proc Electrocute with LeBlanc is to do a quick&nbsp;<strong>Q+W+Basic Attack</strong>&nbsp;combo. If you take the&nbsp;<strong>+10 Attack Speed</strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" data-type="post" data-id="9325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;adaptive force rune</a>, you can do this combo in a blink of an eye. Fizz won’t be able to react this fast!&nbsp;<strong>Taste of Blood</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Manaflow Band</strong>&nbsp;is very useful in the early game as it will provide you with some healing and mana regen, which you can <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-proc-mean-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="11153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proc</a> from a safe distance. Suppose you think that you don’t need the healing from&nbsp;<strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong>. In that case, you should consider choosing&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Hunter</strong>, which will lower the cooldown on your ultimate ability and give you more mobility.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Counter Fizz? Best Tips:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Go all-in on him after he uses E (Playful/Trickster).</li><li>Avoid staying in the lane with low health because his W (Seastone Trident) deals more damage to low health targets.</li><li>If you’re worried about him one-shotting you, consider getting Banshee’s Veil because it can completely negate Fizz’s ultimate, and his entire combo is lost when your Banshee’s is up.</li><li>Always try to take advantage of the time when his abilities are on cooldown.</li><li>Harass him in the early game with your basic attacks.</li><li>Fizz is a mana-hungry champion; try to bait his abilities.</li><li>Use pings on time because Fizz likes to roam.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>LeBlanc vs Fizz is a pretty even matchup, and its outcome depends solely on the early phase of the game. Always look for space to harass Fizz from a safe distance with your basic attacks, and if he decided to go all-in on you, as soon as he uses his&nbsp;<strong>Q</strong>, throw a&nbsp;<strong>chain (E)</strong>&nbsp;on him because he won&#8217;t have the time to react and use his E. Once you&#8217;ve landed a chain on him you can either escape or finish him off with your&nbsp;<strong>Q+W+Ignite</strong>&nbsp;combo. Since Fizz likes to roam bot, make sure to use pings to warn your teammates so they can go back under their tower on time. We hope that you liked our LeBlanc vs. Fizz guide, and we wish you the best of luck in the fields of justice!</p>
