<h1><strong>Teemo in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h1>



<p>When it comes to Teemo in ARAM, season 11 is his time to shine! The little devil has recently received an indirect buff in the form of a patch note. In fact, Riot Games did remove the Oracle’s Extract potion, which made it possible for us to see invisible traps and champions. And Teemo is now unbeatable! There is almost nothing that can uncover him or his mushrooms, so nothing to counter him with! So if you want to know how to best build and play Teemo in ARAM in season 11, then you’ve come to the right place!</p>



<p>But, the “no counterplay” detail isn’t the only power spike that Teemo received in season 11! His go-to mythic item,&nbsp;<strong>Liandry’s Anguish</strong>, now not only boosts the damage of his R &#8211; Noxious Trap, but it also provides him with mana and ability haste! This is crucial for his&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/tips-for-better-early-game/" rel="noreferrer noopener">early game</a>&nbsp;strength because his Q &#8211; Blinding Dart becomes basically free to cast.</p>



<p>Teemo excels in every situation, really. He is good at hitting enemies from afar, and he is good in melee range. Hell, he doesn’t even have to appear on the map to kill you! With the right build, Teemo can take down&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy champions</a>&nbsp;from 1 to 2 well-placed mushrooms. As long as you follow this guide, you’ll be able to dominate your games, if not win them all! So let’s learn how to best build Teemo in ARAM in season 11!</p>



<h1><strong>Best Build for Teemo in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h1>



<h2><strong>Best runes for Teemo in ARAM</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="572" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-1024x572.png" alt="Teemo can be played in multiple different ways, but we feel like that the Dark Harvest keystone is the perfect rune for him in ARAM. Since ARAM is a fact-paced game mode, Teemo will be able to proc the Dark Harvest very fast, which will turn him in an unstoppable beast!" class="wp-image-10457" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-1024x572.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-768x429.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-1536x858.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-2048x1144.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-750x419.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-1140x637.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Dark Harvest</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Dark Harvest</strong>&nbsp;is the keystone you want to pick up on Teemo. Because ARAM is a much more chaotic and fast-paced&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-featured-game-modes-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">game mode</a>&nbsp;than ranked Summoner’s Rift, things like Dark Harvest stack exceptionally quickly. This just means that every time your enemies will step on one of your mushrooms, the initial burst will be almost tripled. And that plays a key part in doing as much damage as possible as Teemo in ARAM in season 11!</p>



<h3><strong>Cheap Shot</strong></h3>



<p>And the second mandatory rune is, of course,&nbsp;<strong>Cheap Shot</strong>. Cheap Shot adds true bonus damage to your traps, so it will maximize the potential of every individual mushroom. The crazy thing about it is that this rune has only 4 seconds cooldown. So by the time an enemy champion steps on the next trap, it will activate again!</p>



<h3><strong>Eyeball Collection</strong></h3>



<p>In the third row, we choose&nbsp;<strong>Eyeball Collection&nbsp;</strong>for two reasons. First, the other two runes are all about warding, which you can’t do in ARAM. And second, Eyeball Collection is the only damage increase. So it&#8217;s a nice buff to possess.</p>



<h3><strong>Ultimate Hunter</strong></h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Hunter</strong>&nbsp;just doubles the fun of playing Teemo in ARAM. With every kill or an assist you take, Ultimate Hunter will lower the cooldown of your R. The more enemies you slay, the more traps you can put out! And the more traps you can set, the more people you’re going to kill! Honestly, this is the best-performing rune for Teemo, and you’ll be wise to play with it!</p>



<h3><strong>Presence of Mind</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Presence of Mind</strong>&nbsp;will provide you with enough mana throughout the game. It boosts the mana regeneration during combat tenfold, while restoring 15% instantly after scoring an enemy takedown. This is a way too useful rune to pass out on, so make sure to select it.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Coup de Grace</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Coup de Grace&nbsp;</strong>plays a vital part in finishing off enemies. It will make you deal more damage to targets under 40% HP. In other words, no enemy will ever survive on 1 HP. Instead, you’ll be able to score those kills way more easily.</p>



<h3><strong>Bonuses</strong></h3>



<p>The bonuses are the easiest part of Teemo’s ARAM build in season 11. Two&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Adaptive Forces</strong></a>&nbsp;plus an&nbsp;<strong>Armor/Magic Resist&nbsp;</strong>rune will get the job done in almost every game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Best items for Teemo in ARAM</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="575" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-1024x575.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10456" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-1024x575.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-768x431.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-1536x862.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-2048x1150.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-750x421.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-1140x640.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Liandry’s Anguish</strong></h3>



<p>As we mentioned above,&nbsp;<strong>Liandry’s Anguish</strong>&nbsp;is the only mythic item to consider on Teemo. It just completes his ability kit and the way he is supposed to be played. Once you complete the item, the passive burning becomes almost unplayable for any champion in the game. And unless they buy a bunch of magic resist, they’re going to melt away!</p>



<h3><strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes</strong></h3>



<p>And to help you out with the magic resist problem,&nbsp;<strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes</strong>&nbsp;will be your first choice. The amount of magic penetration they bring to the build is enough to last you to the late game. The upgrade is only 800 gold, so make sure to get it as soon as possible.</p>



<h3><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong></h3>



<p>The third best item for Teemo in ARAM is&nbsp;<strong>Demonic Embrace</strong>. This item is ridiculously strong against tanky champions. It burns them with damage based on their maximum health, so the more HP they purchase, the more damage you’re going to deal with them!</p>



<h3><strong>Morellonomicon</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Morellonomicon&nbsp;</strong>is your best friend when it comes to dealing with healing comps. And Teemo is excellent with it because the Grevious Wounds effect takes place as soon as his enemies step on his traps. So not only will they burn, but they will also not be able to heal the damage up!</p>



<h3><strong>Void Staff</strong></h3>



<p>As a fifth item,&nbsp;<strong>Void Staff</strong>&nbsp;will be the best option! By the time you reach this stage in the game, the chances are that your opponents will already have one or more magic resist items. So adding Void Staff will nullify their purchases and make you even deadlier!</p>



<h3><strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong></h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>&nbsp;is the ultimate item to end the game with! Adding it lastly on top of all that ability power is a massive power spike that makes it almost impossible for Teemo to lose. A well-placed mushrooms, and the game is yours!</p>



<h2><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>The first thing to take care of is Summoner’s Spells. For Teemo in ARAM,&nbsp;<strong>Flash&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Heal</strong>&nbsp;will always be the best choice. Flash is helpful in every scenario, and it’s a mandatory spell in League of Legends. And no other choice performs better than Heal since Teemo has no need for mana regen or slow effects, for example.</p>

<h1><strong>Vel’Koz in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h1>



<p>Welcome to our guide on how to best build Vel’Koz in ARAM in season 11 of League of Legends! Here we will take a look at which&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-get-more-league-of-legends-rune-pages/" rel="noreferrer noopener">runes</a>&nbsp;you should pick up before every game, as well as which items you should buy while you’re playing. If you’ve never mastered Vel’Koz as a champion or you have never given him a chance, now is the time to do so!</p>



<p>In truth, Vel’Koz is one of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">strongest champions</a>&nbsp;that you can get in ARAM, and here is why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, Vel’Koz possesses an unbelievable amount of damage! His passive &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Organic Deconstruction</strong>&nbsp;gives him a true damage effect, something that most other mage champions simply lack. All of his active abilities have an incredible amount of range, making him a very safe pick for all sorts of situations! And not to mention the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a>&nbsp;through his Q and E!</p>



<p>Among the few weak points to playing Vel’Koz is that of his defensiveness. He is a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy champion</a>&nbsp;and a very easy one to eliminate once enemies get close enough. Plus, his abilities require at least some skill at aiming in League of Legends, and if you aren’t great at this, Vel’Koz may feel very underwhelming to you.</p>



<p>However, skill shots can be practiced and mastered. The important thing to understand here is that if you give Vel’Koz a chance, you can truly become seriously dangerous in LoL. But, you won’t become truly OP without the best build for Vel’Koz in ARAM in season 11!</p>



<h1><strong>Best Build for Vel’Koz in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h1>



<h2><strong>Best runes for Vel&#8217;Koz in ARAM</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="574" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-1024x574.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10332" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-1024x574.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-768x431.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-1536x861.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-2048x1148.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-750x421.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-1140x639.png 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3>Arcane Comet</h3>



<p>Vel’Koz’s real strength comes from his poking. Since his abilities have such a long-range, your mission is to spam them as much as possible, at least in ARAM.&nbsp;<strong>Arcane Comet</strong>&nbsp;fits perfectly into this idea by providing one more poking tool. The actual comet is very easy to hit since Vel’Koz’s Q has a slow effect attached.</p>



<h3>Manaflow Band</h3>



<p><strong>Manaflow Band</strong>&nbsp;is an absolute must-have rune for Vel’Koz. It provides an insane amount of mana and mana regeneration, which is more than enough to get you through the early game.</p>



<h3>Transcendence</h3>



<p>Like many mages, Vel’Koz becomes a beast with the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/difference-between-ability-haste-and-cooldown-reduction/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ability haste</a>. The more of it you acquire, the more frequently you can throw your spells and destroy your opponents! Well,&nbsp;<strong>Transcendence&nbsp;</strong>is a free ability haste buff that you benefit from throughout the game, so always pick it up!</p>



<h3>Gathering Storm</h3>



<p><strong>Gathering Storm</strong>&nbsp;isn’t the most useful rune in ARAM since it slowly builds your power and the games aren’t usually 40 minutes long. However, it is very strong on Vel’Koz because he needs every bit of AP that he could get. Vel’Koz’s abilities scale exceptionally well with ability power, so any source is highly appreciated!</p>



<h3>Eyeball Collection</h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Eyeball Collection</strong>&nbsp;is chosen for the same exact purposes! It is among the few other runes that provide flat AP since the start of the game, so we always select it!</p>



<h3>Relentless Hunter</h3>



<p>The next best rune in the Domination tree for Vel’Koz is&nbsp;<strong>Relentless Hunter</strong>. Since Vel’Koz doesn’t have any movement ability, the flat movement speed makes him a viable champion to play. If you feel like you won’t need a lot of peeling, then&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Hunter</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong>&nbsp;might be good options too.</p>



<h2><strong>Bonuses</strong></h2>



<p>The bonus runes for Vel’Koz in ARAM never change. Two&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Adaptive Force</strong></a>&nbsp;runes should always be locked in whenever you get this champion, as well as an&nbsp;<strong>Armor</strong>&nbsp;rune for defensiveness!</p>



<h2><strong>Best items for Vel&#8217;Koz in ARAM</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="575" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-1024x575.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10331" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-1024x575.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-768x431.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-1536x863.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-2048x1150.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-750x421.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-1140x640.png 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3>Luden’s Tempest</h3>



<p>The mythic item that pairs the best with Vel’Koz’s playstyle is&nbsp;<strong>Luden’s Tempest</strong>. This item is seriously nuts when you take into consideration that it boosts all of Vel’Koz’s aspects! It provides him with mana and mana regeneration, then ability haste, and then extra AOE damage whenever he hits an enemy for the first time. This is such a crucial part of Vel’Koz’s build that no one can imagine playing this champion without it!</p>



<h3>Sorcerer’s Shoes</h3>



<p><strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes</strong>&nbsp;are the strongest boots upgrades for Vel’Koz because of the magic penetration. You’re going to need it as much as possible for closing the game, especially against tanky team composition.</p>



<h3>Demonic Embrace</h3>



<p><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong>&nbsp;is the next core to Vel’Koz’s build. It burns enemies based on their maximum HP and can be an insane source of damage throughout the game. And because Vel’Koz can spam his abilities left and right, it is very easy for him to get the full benefit out of this item.</p>



<h3>Morellonomicon</h3>



<p><strong>Morellonomicon</strong>&nbsp;is a scary addition to Vel’Koz’s power. Draining enemy champions without giving them the option to heal can give you some free wins when you play this champion. The Grievous Wounds effect is simply too valuable to pass on on any mage, so always purchase Morellonomicon!</p>



<h3>Zhonya’s Hourglass</h3>



<p><strong>Zhonya’s Hourglass</strong>&nbsp;is the first defensive option that Vel’Koz should get. The Stasis active is extremely useful in all sorts of situations, allowing you to outplay your opponents every 2 minutes. It also provides you with armor, ability power, and ability haste, which are some of the most needed stats for Vel’Koz!</p>



<h3>Rabadon’s Deathcap</h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>&nbsp;is the last item that you should get as Vel’Koz. It’s very good for closing out games since it almost doubles your AP and thus lets you win team fights more easily. It’s also very easy to purchase this item in ARAM, so make sure you do it every game!</p>



<h2><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>The best Summoner’s Spells choices for Vel’Koz in ARAM are&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Heal</strong>. Flash is absolutely a necessary part of playing immobile champions like Vel’Koz. And Heal helps you with staying alive since Vel’Koz doesn’t have any defensive ability. However, you can opt for&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>&nbsp;if you have supports like Soraka in your team!</p>

<h1><strong>Maokai in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h1>



<p>Welcome to our guide on how to play Maokai in ARAM! Here we will lay out for you the best build for Maokai in ARAM in season 11, as well as some additional tips and things to do every game. Maokai doesn’t have a very strict build path, but he does need some items more than others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being primarily a tank, Maokai benefits the most from the defensive items, such as&nbsp;<strong>Spirit Visage</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Thornmail</strong>. However, he is also an AP based champion, and his abilities can be quite devastating if you put a bit of power into them. So you’ll be wise to also consider getting offensive items as well.</p>



<p>Maokai’s main strength comes from his ability to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a>&nbsp;his enemies while healing a significant portion of the damage he is taking and peeling for his teammates. He is one of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/9-easiest-league-of-legends-champions-to-learn/" rel="noreferrer noopener">easiest champions</a>&nbsp;to maneuver, and his abilities are fairly easy to set up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only underwhelming feeling you can get when playing Maokai is the&nbsp;lack of damage. However, we will show you how to eliminate this problem by purchasing a bit of ability power and then stomping your enemies. And with that said, let’s jump into the best build for Maokai in ARAM in season 11!</p>



<h1><strong>Best Build for Maokai in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h1>



<h2><strong>Best Runes for Maokai in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h2>

<h2>Aftershock</h2>



<p><strong>Aftershock</strong>&nbsp;is the standard keystone choice for Maokai in ARAM. The rune has a powerful offensive and defensive effect that activates when you&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>&nbsp;an enemy champion. So when you root someone as Moakai, Aftershock will give you bonus armor and magic resist, but it will also explode after 2.5 seconds and deal massive amounts of damage. This is very helpful in all situations!</p>



<h2>Font of Life</h2>



<p><strong>Font of Life</strong>&nbsp;can be an incredible source of healing for your whole team. The rune works like this: when you root an enemy champion, that champion gets marked for 4 seconds. During these 4 seconds, any ally that attacks the marked champion will heal himself for up to 4.5% of their maximum HP, which is pretty handy.</p>



<h2>Conditioning</h2>



<p><strong>Conditioning</strong>&nbsp;is a lovely safe card for Maokai in case he falls behind during the game. After 12 minutes, the rune grants you bonus armor and magic resist, equal to almost one complete item. This is an extremely useful rune, so make sure to prioritize it!</p>



<h2>Revitalize</h2>



<p>Maokai is very good at self-healing.&nbsp;<strong>Revitalize</strong>&nbsp;boosts this strength and also grants you bonus healing from additional sources, such as ally champions. It is a very helpful rune overall and considered a must for Maokai in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-featured-game-modes-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">League of Legends&#8217; game modes</a>.</p>



<h2>Triumph</h2>



<p>Moving over to the Precision tree,&nbsp;<strong>Triumph</strong>&nbsp;is the first rune to pick up! It is one more healing source for Maokai that activates every time he scores a kill or an assist. And because fights are constantly going on in ARAM, you can get a lot of value out of this rune.</p>



<h2>Legend: Tenacity</h2>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Legend: Tenacity</strong>&nbsp;is the last rune you’ll need as Maokai. It helps you tremendously with moving freely because it removes your enemies&#8217; ability to control you. It builds up as you gather kills and assists, so it’s very easy to stack up.</p>



<h2>Bonuses</h2>



<p>As for the bonuses, Moakai’s mostly favors this combination: two&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Adaptive Forces</strong></a>&nbsp;and an&nbsp;<strong>Armor</strong>&nbsp;rune.</p>



<h2><strong>Best Items for Maokai in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="575" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-1024x575.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10275" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-1024x575.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-768x431.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-1536x862.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-2048x1149.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-750x421.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-1140x640.png 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Sunfire Aegis</h2>



<p>By now, it’s no secret that&nbsp;<strong>Sunfire Aegis</strong>&nbsp;is seriously broken in League of Legends. Maokai benefits a lot from the basic stats it brings to the table, but the passive is where all the true strength lies. You see, Sunfire Aegis burns down enemies around you whenever you deal or take damage. This effect stacks multiple times, and it’s very OP. And since it’s very easy for Maokai to get in range with the enemy carries, it makes Sunfire Aegis the strongest mythic item for him!</p>



<h2>Mercury’s Treads</h2>



<p><strong>Mercury’s Treads</strong>&nbsp;are the single-best boots upgrades for Maokai. They give additional resistance to crowd control effects, and combined with Legend: Tenacity, you’ll completely nullify your enemies’ CC potential.</p>



<h2>Demonic Embrace</h2>



<p><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong>&nbsp;is the first offensive purchase for Maokai in ARAM. This item synergizes with Sunfire aegis by adding one more source of burning down enemies. Combined, they can drain any champion in just a few seconds, and they work super well on Maokai!</p>



<h2>Spirit Visage</h2>



<p><strong>Spirit Visage&nbsp;</strong>is a core item to Maokai’s defensiveness. It’s not only good against a heavy AP team, but all around. The passive increases your healing from all sources by 25%, which is really high! And even with Grievous Wounds against you, you’ll still do a tremendous amount of healing.</p>



<h2>Thornmail</h2>



<p><strong>Thornmail</strong>&nbsp;is one of the best tank items in League of Legends and a must-have for Maokai too. The primary reason for purchasing it is to increase your base armor, but the Thorns passive is incredible as well. It damages people when they auto attack you, so you should always try to purchase it, especially against multiple marksman champions.</p>



<h2>Morellonomicon</h2>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Morellonomicon</strong>&nbsp;is a great item to finish the game with. Being able to sustain nearly all damage while giving the enemy no option to do the same is a recipe for victory in ARAM.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>The best combination of Summoner’s Spells for Maokai in ARAM is&nbsp;<strong>Flash&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Mark</strong>. Flash is pretty much a must in League of Legends, and&nbsp;<strong>Mark</strong>&nbsp;fits very well with Maokai’s playstyle. If you can get good snowballs, you’ll be able to instantly root enemies and win team fights!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-does-mmr-work/" data-type="post" data-id="8291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMR</a> is simply a match-making rating in League of Legends. Its origins go back to at least season 2 and season 3 of League of Legends. A similar method of rating is also used in many other games as well including basketball. Riot didn’t actually start a ranked-tier system for the Howling Abyss where the League of Legends game mode ARAM is played. Instead, the ranked system began for ranked matches played in the Summoner’s Rift. The term “<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/which-ranks-are-considered-as-high-elo-ones-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high elo</a>” comes from meaning high rank in the League of Legends Tier system.</p>



<p>Accordingly, higher-ranked players are matched up with players at a similarly ranked tier to ensure competition remains healthy. Thus it seems MMR is only for matches played in the Summoner’s Rift.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Is there MMR for ARAM as well?</strong></h2>



<p>However, many players have reported being faced with more formidable or more accessible opponents in the ARAM mode as well. This must mean that there some logic to how players are matched in ARAM as well. The MMR number represents a league of legends player’s skill level. It determines the opponents you play against. If you are new, it’s likely that you won’t be matched against higher-skilled players. Although players often use ARAM mode to warm up for Summoner’s Rift, which is the primary game mode for League of Legends, ARAM itself can be very challenging and fun to play.</p>

<h2><strong>MMR is different for Queue types:</strong></h2>



<p>Your ARAM match-making rating will be different from your Summoner’s Rift rating. You can’t expect to win ARAM matches in a series and then expect to have a higher MMR for the classic 5v5 game as well. Similarly, your solo Q rating will be different from than duo queue rating. If you have a 5-member squad, playing with this team will affect your MMR in another way. So don’t start thinking if you are good at 5v5 in the Summoner’s Rift, then you are automatically entitled to play the best players in ARAM as well. The rating for each queue type and for each game mode is different for you. There is an entire match-making guide on the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games’ website</a>&nbsp;if you want to know more in detail.</p>



<h2><strong>How is MMR related to ELO?</strong></h2>



<p>Ranked game modes use the League Points or LP in addition to the MMOR to rank players. Your MMR and the average MMR of your tier/division determine your Elo in ranked matches. If you are on an unbeatable winning strike, then it means you are playing better than the average MMR for your tier, and you will get more LP per match. Conversely, if you start losing games, it will mean you are playing below the average MMR for your tier, and you lost more LP points.</p>

<h2><strong>How to check MMR for ARAM?</strong></h2>



<p>Although MMR records and ratings are kept internal to Riot Games, various fan-made tools can help you find your own MMR. One of the tools is&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://na.whatismymmr.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://na.whatismymmr.com/</a>, which explains what MMR is and its relation to Elo. You have to have played in the last 30 days to get an MMR rating. This tool is not available in all servers yet, unfortunately. Similarly, the website&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://aram.academy/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://aram.academy/</a>&nbsp;offers a very extensive guide into ARAM and how to improve your performance in this game mode. Both these websites are fan-made. Riot had no part to play in this.</p>

<h2>Viktor in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>



<p>Unlike in the past, Viktor is currently one of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-solo-queue-champions-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8813">best champions to dominate season </a>11, especially in ARAM. Riot Games have reworked his passive, and Viktor no longer requires an external item to boost his damage. All he needs is a&nbsp;<strong>Luden’s Tempest</strong>&nbsp;to start one-shotting people left and right.</p>



<p>Viktor isn’t the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/the-most-difficult-league-of-legends-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8685">hardest champion to master</a>, and after a couple of games, you’re going to feel comfortable with him. He has an extremely useful kit that lets him do damage but also to survive prolonged fights. He runs fast, bursts often, and is overall an excellent team-oriented champion!</p>



<p>The only negative side to playing Viktor is that he is an immobile champion. It can be very easy for him to fall into the enemy’s hands or get overrun. So positioning smartly is a crucial part, as well as getting alternative mobility options from his build.</p>



<p>So if you’re interested in playing Viktor in ARAM in season 11, then you’ve come to the right place to get the best build possible! Here we will take a look at the rune choices, item paths, spells, and all the additional tips and tricks that you’re going to need.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Best Build for Viktor in ARAM in Season 11</h1>



<h3>Summoner’s Spells</h3>



<p>In ARAM, Viktor goes best with&nbsp;<strong>Flash&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Mark</strong>. Flash helps you with literally everything and is a great offensive and defensive tool. And Mark allows you to reach your targets since Viktor doesn’t have the biggest ability range.</p>



<p>But, know that&nbsp;<strong>Ghost</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>&nbsp;are both viable options in certain situations. If the enemy team has a lot of tanks and you need to kite, then Ghost will be the better choice. And if no one on your team has Clarity, then the extra mana might prove necessary for the early game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Best Runes for Viktor in ARAM</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="574" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-1024x574.png" alt="Sure, Dark Harvest is not very OP in the Summoners Rift if you don't get enough stacks, but it's a completely different story on ARAM. There are usually more kills in ARAM games than in Summoner Rift ones, which means that Dark Harvest is the best rune path for Viktor in ARAM. We've explained why each of these runes is the perfect choice for him, and we sincerely believe that you can't go wrong if you choose to follow our guide!" class="wp-image-9958" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-1024x574.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-768x430.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-1536x861.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-2048x1147.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-192x108.png 192w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-384x216.png 384w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-364x205.png 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-728x409.png 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-561x314.png 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-1122x629.png 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-608x341.png 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-758x426.png 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-1152x645.png 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-313x175.png 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Dark Harvest</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Dark Harvest</strong>&nbsp;is the single-best keystone for ARAM, and Viktor benefits significantly from it. Since you’re going to fight 99% of the time, you’re going to collect a lot of souls. Each stack significantly increases Viktor’s burst potential. And with enough stacks, Viktor becomes really deadly. One E &#8211; Q combo is enough to delete anyone from Howling Fjord!</li></ul>



<h3>Taste of Blood</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Taste of Blood&nbsp;</strong>plays a vital part in Viktor’s survivability. Every 10 seconds, this rune heals you passively as you deal your damage. It’s really a no-brainer because neither&nbsp;<strong>Sudden Impact</strong>&nbsp;nor&nbsp;<strong>Cheap Shot</strong>&nbsp;can give Viktor as much value as&nbsp;<strong>Taste of Blood</strong>&nbsp;can.</li></ul>



<h3>Eyeball Collection</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Eyeball Collection&nbsp;</strong>is the only damage increase in the third row of the Domination tree. The other two options have to deal with wards and visibility, which in ARAM is practically non-existent. With Eyeball Collection, you’ll be able to boost your AP and reach your power spikes faster.</li></ul>



<h3>Ravenous Hunter</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Ravenous Hunter&nbsp;</strong>is the most powerful last-row choice for Viktor. This rune provides an insane amount of healing if you manage to stack it up quickly. Every kill or assist grant you a stack, so it’s vital to start fighting early on. And paired with Taste of Blood, Ravenous Hunter can be the cornerstone of Viktor’s power throughout the game.</li></ul>



<h3>Presence of Mind</h3>



<ul><li>And&nbsp;<strong>Presence of Mind</strong>&nbsp;is almost the equivalent to Ravenous Hunter. But where Ravenous Hunter heals your HP, Presence of Mind regenerates your mana as you deal damage. We honestly think that this rune is broken, and if not in ranked, then at least on ARAM because it’s totally possible to go the whole game on 100% mana.</li></ul>



<h3>Coup de Grace</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Coup de Grace</strong>&nbsp;is the only other rune that is worth picking up on Viktor. It gives you an 8% damage increase against targets below 40% HP. That simply means that you’re constantly going to deal 8% more damage since everyone is always fighting in ARAM.</li></ul>



<h2>Bonuses</h2>



<ul><li>For bonuses, you want to get two&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" data-type="post" data-id="9325">Adaptive Forces</a></strong>&nbsp;so you can maximize your DPS at the start of the game. And depending on the type of comp you’re facing, pick up an&nbsp;<strong>Armor</strong>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<strong>Magic Resistant</strong>&nbsp;rune.</li></ul>

<h3>1. Luden’s Tempst</h3>



<ul><li>The first item that you need to take care of as Viktor in ARAM is, of course,&nbsp;<strong>Luden’s Tempest</strong>. This item is the best choice for any mage, especially Viktor. The amount of raw power, mana regen, and the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/difference-between-ability-haste-and-cooldown-reduction/" data-type="post" data-id="9901">ability haste</a> it provides are honestly too valuable to miss. And immediately after purchasing Luden’s Tempest, Viktor can start taking over games on his own.</li></ul>



<h3>2. Sorcerer’s Shoes</h3>



<ul><li>After purchasing Ludens’s echo, the smartest option is to upgrade your boots.&nbsp;<strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes</strong>&nbsp;are your best friend because they bring more than enough magic penetration for the early and the mid-game.</li></ul>



<h3>3. Lich Bane</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Lich Bane</strong>&nbsp;is an incredible power spike on Viktor, so always aim to get it as fast as possible. It synergizes exceptionally well with his Q &#8211; Siphon Power and adds a lot of value to Viktor’s one-shot potential. Almost all of Viktor’s abilities are in the auto-attack range, so you won’t have any trouble proccing the effect.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>Zhonyas’s Hourglass</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Zhonya’s Hourglass</strong>&nbsp;is your only viable defensive item as Viktor. The flat Armor helps a lot against a full AD team, and the active is literally a life-saver. And remember that you can buy&nbsp;<strong>Stopwatch&nbsp;</strong>separately and double the value of the Stasis.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3><strong>5. Morellonomicon</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Morellonomicon&nbsp;</strong>is an awesome item that allows you to defeat the tanks and the healers in League of Legends. The Grievous Wounds debuff can be crucial against such comps, so make sure to pick it up in every game.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>6. Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong></h3>



<ul><li>And for the end, we have&nbsp;<strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>. You essentially want to buy this item for closing the game since your damage numbers will skyrocket, and you’ll be able to shift+delete anyone.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Optional item</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Void Staff</strong>&nbsp;can also be an excellent choice if you already have enough AP but lack the magic penetration to melt your opponents.</li></ul>

<h2>Zoe in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>



<p>Zoe is the kind of champion in League of Legends that you can go all nuts with. Whether it’s high damage or long-range, Zoe takes the crown as one of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">greatest champions to carry</a>&nbsp;Howling Fjord games with. What we’re going to discuss here will help you understand how to best build Zoe in ARAM in season 11, as well as play and master her to always win.</p>



<p><em>But first of all, why is Zoe so strong in ARAM?</em></p>



<p>Well, one reason &#8211; one-shot! You see, Zoe’s ability kit perfectly fits the craziness of ARAM. Zoe usually hits outside of her enemies’ visibility, thanks to her Q &#8211; Paddle Star and her R &#8211; Portal Jump. On top of that, her E &#8211; Sleepy Trouble Bubble can travel from base to base if you cast it vertically along the two main walls of Howling Fjord. And not to mention that Zoe grabs all Summoner’s Spells and items for free to either damage or heal herself!</p>



<p>All of this combined makes Zoe one of the deadliest and the safest champions to play in League of Legends. An experienced Zoe player would never put himself in real danger, while at the same time, he would destroy everyone on the map. This is the biggest strength of Zoe, and here we’re going to teach you how to take advantage of that by getting the best build specifically for ARAM in season 11. Let’s go!</p>



<h1>Best Build for Zoe in ARAM in Season 11</h1>



<h2>Summoner’s Spells</h2>



<p>Since you will be taking everyone else’s Summoner’s Spells,&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Ignite</strong>&nbsp;are the best ones for Zoe. Flash is here to get you out of trouble or to increase the range/damage of your Q, while Ignite will finish off opponents.</p>



<h2>Best Runes for Zoe on ARAM</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-zoe-on-ARAM-1024x576.png" alt="Dark Harvest is probably the best choice when it comes to runes for Zoe in ARAM.

<h3>Dark Harvest</h3>



<ul><li>As Zoe, you would typically go something like Electrocute or Summon Aery in ranked games. But in ARAM,&nbsp;<strong>Dark Harvest</strong>&nbsp;is by far the best-performing keystone on this champion. If you’re only decent at skill shots, you’re going to collect a lot of souls. This will help you stack your potential and ultimately start one-shotting people only 10 minutes in the game!</li></ul>



<h3>Taste of Blood</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Taste of Blood&nbsp;</strong>is an excellent rune because Zoe is one of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/">easiest champions to kill</a>, really. Besides her E, she doesn’t have any other defensive ability to protect herself if enemies come close to her. So, any healing you get out of your damaging spells is a huge bonus!</li></ul>



<h3>Eyeball Collection</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Eyeball Collection&nbsp;</strong>is the rune we choose in the third row of the Domination page, simply because it’s the only damage increase one. The rune stacks by slaying enemy champions, which you’re going to do anyway in ARAM, so it’s an awesome rune to have!</li></ul>



<h3>Ravenous Hunter</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong>&nbsp;plays the same role as Taste of Blood. It boosts Zoe’s survivability and gives her a way to heal up when she gets close to dying. The best thing about it is that the healing happens through your damaging spells. So not only you don’t have to stop your DPS, but you will regenerate health thanks to it!</li></ul>



<h3>Presence of Mind</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Presence of Mind</strong>&nbsp;is the favorite rune of any mage, including Zoe! It significantly boosts your mana regeneration up to the point where your early game is secured. Plus, with every champion takedown, Presence of Mind restores 15% of your mana. And because kills happen all the time in ARAM, you can see why this rune is mandatory!</li></ul>



<h3>Coup de Grace</h3>



<ul><li>And&nbsp;<strong>Coup de Grace&nbsp;</strong>is the second-best rune in the Precision tree. It increases your power against targets below 40% HP, which is fantastic for securing kills.</li></ul>



<h3>Bonuses</h3>



<ul><li>As Zoe, you want to take two&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/"><strong>Adaptive Forces</strong></a>&nbsp;from your bonuses, as well as an&nbsp;<strong>Armor&nbsp;</strong>or a&nbsp;<strong>Magic Resist</strong>.</li></ul>



<h2>Best Items for Zoe on ARAM</h2>

<h3>1. Luden’s Tempest</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Luden’s Tempest</strong>&nbsp;is the first must-have item we’re looking at for Zoe in ARAM. As a mythic item, it outperforms every other choice by far. It boosts Zoe’s first hit every 10 seconds and gives her an AOE effect. This helps her do more damage with only one ability and also have an easier time when collecting souls for Dark Harvest.</li></ul>



<h3>2. Sorcerer’s Shoes</h3>



<ul><li>For a second item upgrade, it’s<strong>&nbsp;</strong>always good to go for&nbsp;<strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes</strong>. The extra magic penetration adds a lot of power to Zoe’s kit in the early game, especially if the enemy team doesn’t have much magic resist. It allows her to essentially melt enemy champions with her base abilities.</li></ul>



<h3>3. Horizon Focus</h3>



<ul><li>Next, we have&nbsp;<strong>Horizon Focus</strong>. This item honestly looks like it’s made specifically for Zoe. Every time you hit someone over 750 range, that enemy is then revealed and takes more damage from you! So every time you land your Sleepy Trouble Bubble through a wall or your Paddle Star together with Portal Jump, you obliterate everyone on the other end!</li></ul>



<h3>4. Lich Bane</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Lich Bane</strong>&nbsp;is the fourth-best item for Zoe in ARAM. Thanks to its passive, you’ll be able to destroy Turrets and secure victories faster. Also, combined with Zoe’s passive &#8211; More Sparkles, her auto-attack can deal as much damage as an ability!</li></ul>



<h3>5. Rabadon’s Deathcap</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>&nbsp;is a core item in Zoe’s build. It is best to be bought later in the game when you’ve already stacked on a bit of AP. Rabadon’s then will almost double your amount and make you a real death machine! So never forget to pick it up!</li></ul>



<h3>6. Void Staff</h3>



<ul><li>And lastly, we have&nbsp;<strong>Void Staff</strong>. Unless your enemy team is full of tanks, Sorcerer’s Shoes will give you enough magic penetration for the first part of the game. However, when they start building MR, it’s almost mandatory for you to purchase Void Staff on Zoe. It keeps people away, and it helps you secure kills. So always buy it!</li></ul>

<h2>Ziggs in ARAM in Season 11</h2>



<p>Ziggs is one of the best champions to carry a game of ARAM with in season 11. His build revolves around dealing heavy AOE damage while staying out of trouble the whole time. Ziggs’ abilities aren’t the easiest to hit, but they have both the range and reach. That makes him one of the safest and scariest champions in League of Legends. Because who cares if you just missed a few bombs when you have thousands more to throw?</p>



<p>Here we will discuss the best item build, rune choices, and everything else that you need to know to own the ARAM scene as Ziggs in season 11. Know that this guide will apply to Summoner’s Rift and ranked games too. However, it’s designed primarily to give you the optimal outcome in an ARAM game by providing you with the most amount of damage and utility to carry your team. So, let’s begin!</p>



<h2>Summoner’s Spells</h2>



<p>For Ziggs, you want to pick up&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>&nbsp;as Summoner’s Spells. Flash is mandatory for almost any champion and game mode. It’s a necessary button for either escaping or scoring a kill.</p>



<p>Clarity helps tremendously with mana regeneration, especially in the first 10 minutes of the game. However, if one or two of your teammates have also selected Clarity as one of their spells, then&nbsp;<strong>Heal,&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Barrier</strong>&nbsp;will be your best choice. Or just pick up&nbsp;<strong>Mark</strong>&nbsp;and go all-in!</p>



<h2>Best Runes for Ziggs in ARAM</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="547" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-1024x547.png" alt="This image shows a best set of runes for Ziggs on ARAM game mode. Ziggs will deal most damage when he's using a Domination as primary set of his runes, and Precision as the second set of his runes. If you stack it right, you'll deal massive damage with Dark Harvest." class="wp-image-9933" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-1024x547.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-300x160.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-768x410.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-1536x821.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-561x300.png 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-1122x599.png 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-364x194.png 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-728x389.png 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-608x325.png 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-758x405.png 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-1152x615.png 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24-313x167.png 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.52.24.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Dark Harvest</h3>



<ul><li>When it comes to ARAM,&nbsp;<strong>Dark Harvest</strong>&nbsp;is the king! Ziggs has numerous ways to proc its effect since his damage never really stops. Collecting souls is one of the easiest things that you can do because every one of your abilities flies over half the map and has a very wide hitbox. And with enough stacks, you have a pretty good chance of one-shotting any squishy champion in the game!</li></ul>



<h3>Taste of Blood</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Taste of Blood</strong>&nbsp;is the preferred choice in the second row of the Domination tree. It gives you a way to regenerate your missing health every 20 seconds, which is quite handy in ARAM. Ziggs is essentially a squishy champion himself, and every poke is a threat to his life.</li></ul>



<h3>Eyeball Collection</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Eyeball Collection</strong>&nbsp;is simply the best third-row option.&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Poro</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Zombie Ward</strong>&nbsp;are pretty useless in ARAM since no one can buy wards nor stay in a brush for a longer period of time. Eyeball Collection boosts your damage up a bit, so make sure to have it selected!</li></ul>



<h3>Ravenous Hunter</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong>&nbsp;completes Taste of Blood. Combined, they can give you significant health regeneration while dealing damage! Ravenous Hunter stacks with kills and assists, which is very easy to do in ARAM. You could go&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Hunter</strong>&nbsp;if you want, but Ziggs has more than enough damage without it, while little to none defensive options.</li></ul>



<h3>Presence of Mind</h3>



<ul><li>The only reason why you want to go for Precision as secondary runes is&nbsp;<strong>the Presence of Mind</strong>. This rune is nuts on its own, but in ARAM, it reaches new heights of broken! The amount of mana you can regenerate is enough to get you from the beginning to the end of the game without any other mana source! And more mana means more damage!</li></ul>



<h3>Coup de Grace</h3>



<ul><li>And&nbsp;<strong>Coup de Grace</strong>&nbsp;is an excellent finisher to pick up along the way. It synergizes very well with Dark Harvest and enhances your one-shot potential!</li></ul>



<h3>Bonuses</h3>



<ul><li>There aren’t many options when it comes to choosing bonuses for Ziggs. So two&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" data-type="post" data-id="9325">Adaptive Forces</a></strong>&nbsp;will be a standard pickup. And depending on the opponent you’re facing, one&nbsp;<strong>Armor&nbsp;</strong>or one&nbsp;<strong>Magic Resist</strong>&nbsp;is enough to get you going!</li></ul>



<h2>Best Items for Ziggs in ARAM</h2>

If you choose the right items, Ziggs can deal a massive AOE damage with his abilities. Here's the best items for Ziggs on ARAM." class="wp-image-9934" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48.png 726w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48-300x265.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48-561x496.png 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48-364x322.png 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48-608x538.png 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48-313x277.png 313w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></figure>



<h3>Luden’s Tempest</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Luden’s Tempest</strong>&nbsp;is the next thing that synergizes greatly with both Dark Harvest and Ziggs as a champion. The active echo helps you gather souls quickly while pumping your DPS every 10 seconds. The item is built with&nbsp;<strong>Lost Chapter</strong>, which is the best starting item for Ziggs in League of Legends overall.</li></ul>



<h3>Sorcerer’s Shoes</h3>



<ul><li>Upgrading your boots to&nbsp;<strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes&nbsp;</strong>early is a very good idea, especially if you’re ahead. The extra magic penetration will help you stay on top of your game and stop every opponent from doing the same.</li></ul>



<h3>Demonic Embrace</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong>&nbsp;is the best choice for a third item for two reasons: damage and price! This item significantly boosts your DPS output by not only giving you flat AP, but a passive that burns enemies for 1.2 max Health magic damage. And it only costs 3000 gold, which you can quickly gather with a couple of kills.</li></ul>



<h3>Morellonomicon</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Morellonomicon&nbsp;</strong>is your friend when it comes to dealing with healing comps. It can be pretty tough to stop all the passive healing that’s going on in season 11 of League of Legends, but Morellonomicon comes pretty close. And we recommend you to always purchase it on Ziggs!</li></ul>



<h3>Rabadon’s Deathcap</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>&nbsp;is the next best thing for Ziggs. The item has only one job &#8211; to maximize your damage potential. Ziggs scales extremely well with raw AP, so getting Rabadon’s Deathcap is a must for him!</li></ul>



<h3>Void Staff</h3>



<ul><li>And&nbsp;<strong>Void Staff</strong>&nbsp;is the best item to finish a game with. The amount of power it will add to your ability is incredibly crazy. The magic penetration will help you melt tanks and delete squishy champions from Howling Fjord! So always aim to get Void Staff as Ziggs on ARAM!</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Mordekaiser in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h2>



<p>If you want to learn the best build for Mordekaiser in ARAM in season 11, then you’ve come to the right place! Mordekaiser is an extremely <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-hyper-carries/" data-type="post" data-id="9744">powerful champion</a> that can 1v5 matches as you know what to do with him. Here we will take a deep dive on which items and runes are must-haves for Mordekaiser in ARAM in Season 11, as well as talk about some of his true strengths.</p>



<p>When it comes to Mordekaiser and Howling Fjord, his playstyle isn’t too different from ranked Summoner’s Rift. Being an AP melee champion, Mordekaiser’s power requires some setup. The main thing to master is his E &#8211; Death’s Grasp. This ability has a fairly long cooldown during the early game, so you don’t want to waste it on the minions.</p>



<p>Mordekaiser’s W &#8211; Indestructible, gives him a shield and heal, which are essential for surviving in ARAM. His Q &#8211; Obliterate is one of the hardest-hitting abilities in League of Legends when “beefed” up with the right build. And his R &#8211; Realm of Death grants Mordekaiser a free kill in 99% of the situations.</p>



<p>All of this combined makes a very easy and very dominating champion. Mordekaiser’s true strength lies in his ability to 1v1 any champion in the game. So if you want to succeed as Mordekaiser, start by eliminating enemy players one by one!</p>



<p>Now let’s jump onto the build!</p>



<h2><strong>Best Build for Mordekaiser in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h2><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>The Summoner’s Spells for Mordekaiser seldom change!&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>&nbsp;is mandatory for all champions, and&nbsp;<strong>Mark&nbsp;</strong>is the next best mobility spell in ARAM! You can sometimes swap it for&nbsp;<strong>Ignite</strong>, but since Mordekaiser doesn’t have any dashes or leaps, Mark will be necessary for gap-closing!</p>



<h2><strong>Best runes for ARAM Mordekaiser</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="574" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-1024x574.png" alt="Runes for Mordekaiser are basically the same ones that you would use on the Summoners Rift. Nothing's different. The main rune for him is Conqueror, alongside with Triumph, Last Stand, Taste of Blood, and Ravenous Hunter. " class="wp-image-10606" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-1024x574.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-768x430.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-1536x861.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-2048x1148.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-750x420.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-1140x639.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Conqueror</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Conqueror&nbsp;</strong>is the go-to keystone for Mordekaiser in all game modes in League of Legends. This rune is simply amazing for melee champions for the raw healing and damage it provides during a fight. With every attack and ability against an enemy champion, you buff up with bonus adaptive damage and healing. Mordekaiser can very quickly stack this rune up, which makes a natural choice for him.</p>



<h3><strong>Triumph</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Triumph</strong>&nbsp;is a must for many champions in LoL, including Mordekaiser. Since Morde is 99% of the time in the front line, constantly fighting, he desperately needs passive healing. Triumph restores HP after every kill/assist and is a very useful rune on Mordekaiser.</p>



<h3><strong>Legend: Tenacity</strong></h3>



<p>And since Morde doesn’t have any form of mobility in his kit, crowd control abilities can certainly stop him from carrying the game. Well,&nbsp;<strong>Legend: Tenacity</strong>&nbsp;removes a significant portion of these effects by making him almost immune to them. So make sure to pick it up every game!</p>



<h3><strong>Last Stand</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Last Stand</strong>&nbsp;fits perfectly with the playstyle of Mordekaiser. The rune grants up to 11% bonus damage while you’re below 60% HP. Mordekaiser isn’t a squishy champion, but he is very susceptible to poking and being slowly drained. So having extra power while being on low HP is very useful for him!</p>



<h3><strong>Taste of Blood</strong></h3>



<p>The core idea of playing Mordekaiser is to be a nuisance to anyone in the enemy team by constantly being there up in their faces. But that won’t be possible without self-healing!&nbsp;<strong>Taste of Blood</strong>&nbsp;is a very reliable rune in this sense because every 20 seconds, Mordekaiser gets a “free” heal through one of his abilities!</p>



<h3><strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong></h3>



<p>And the same goes for&nbsp;<strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong>! This rune provides you with up to 2% omnivamp based on stacks you get by scoring kills or assists. It may not seem like much, but with enough champion takedowns, Mordekaiser can top his health only with his W!</p>



<h3><strong>Bonuses</strong></h3>



<p>For the bonus runes, the best combination for Mordekaiser in ARAM is one <strong>Attack Speed</strong> rune, one <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" data-type="post" data-id="9325"><strong>Adaptive Force </strong>rune</a>, and one <strong>Armor/Magic Resist </strong>rune.</p>



<h1><strong>Best items for ARAM Mordekaiser</strong></h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="572" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-mordekaiser-1024x572.png" alt="Even though Mordekaiser is only powerful in the late game, he does a pretty good job in ARAM aswell (if built right). That's why we've decided to make a Mordekaiser ARAM guide to show you the best build for him!" class="wp-image-10605" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-mordekaiser-1024x572.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-mordekaiser-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-mordekaiser-768x429.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-mordekaiser-1536x859.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-mordekaiser-2048x1145.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-mordekaiser-750x419.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-mordekaiser-1140x637.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Riftmaker</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Riftmaker&nbsp;</strong>is a fantastic mythic item that simply works wonders on Mordekaiser! It synergizes extremely well with Conqueror and thus makes Morde one of the scariest champions to face in 1v1. Riftmaker grants stacks of bonus damage for each second spent in combat. And at 10 stacks, Mordekaiser deals true damage!</p>



<h3><strong>Mercury’s Treads</strong></h3>



<p>Remember what we said about Legend: Tenacity and Mordekaiser? Well, the same goes here! The best counterplay to Mordekaiser is CC. But if he can freely walk Howling Fjord, he’ll be the strongest champion in the match! That’s why&nbsp;<strong>Mercury’s Treads</strong>&nbsp;are the must-have boots on Morde!</p>



<h3><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong>&nbsp;is another of those items that slowly charge their powers. This one, however, instead of granting bonus flat damage, burns your enemies based on their maximum HP. It is a very powerful item overall, especially against tanks. Plus, it grants you magic resist and armor while the burning effect is on!</p>



<h3><strong>Rylai’s Crystal Scepter</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Rylai’s Crystal Scepter</strong>&nbsp;has been one of the key items for Mordekaiser’s build ever since the champion was reworked. Due to his short ability range, Morde struggles to chase mobile champions down. So, Rylai’s Crystal Scepter simply helps him keep his enemies in range!</p>



<h3><strong>Zhonya’s Hourglass</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Zhonya’s Hourglass</strong>&nbsp;is a core item as well, simply because Morde has no option of escaping a fight when he is in danger. The active &#8211; Stasis, allows him to by himself some time and turn the duel the other way!</p>



<h3><strong>Spirit Visage</strong></h3>



<p>And as the last item, <strong>Spirit Visage </strong>has proven to be the best choice overall. Needless to say that in any ARAM match there is at least one AP champion in the enemy team, so Spirit Visage will always have at least some value. But the reason why it is a must for Mordekaiser is that it boosts the healing he does during the game. So, make sure to always purchase it!</p>

<h2><strong>Janna in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h2>



<p>If you want the very&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-off-meta-supports/" rel="noreferrer noopener">best support</a>&nbsp;in season 11 in ARAM, then pray to the League of Legends Gods to grant you, Janna! This champion is extremely strong in this game mode because she rises to power only after a few minutes in. Her mythic item is very cheap, and it boosts her potential to carry a hundredfold!</p>



<p>Janna’s power lies in her ability to set up kills but also to avoid getting harmed. Her Q &#8211; Howlin Gale has an excellent range, and it’s much easier to hit in ARAM since the terrain is narrower. Her W &#8211; Zephyr can surprise you with its damage, while her E &#8211; Eye of the Storm becomes a “half-HP” shield when you max it up. And her R &#8211; Monsoon tops everybody’s health, and it’s an invaluable tool for healing in ARAM!</p>



<p>However, the biggest downside to playing Janna is that she can be too&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy</a>. Enemy champions can fairly easy one-shot you or just melt you in one stun. You’ll have to be very careful about how you position, where you click, and which fights you engage in. But if you play on the defensive foot and take all these things into consideration, then you can tilt your opponents in no time!</p>



<p>This is our complete guide on how to best build Janna in season 11 in ARAM, which runes to pick up, as well as what to consider when choosing your Summoner Spells. So let’s begin!</p>

<h2><strong>Best Build for Janna in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h3>



<p>The best Summoner’s Spells for Janna in ARAM are&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>. As Janna, you can frequently end up having mana issues, so Clarity helps a ton with that, especially in the early 5 to 10 minutes. Plus, it helps your team as well.</p>



<p>You can also switch up to&nbsp;<strong>Heal</strong>&nbsp;if your teammates bring&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>&nbsp;of their own.&nbsp;<strong>Mark</strong>&nbsp;can also be a good option if you want to be the playmaker and do inSec kicks with Janna’s ultimate.</p>



<h2><strong>Best runes for Janna in ARAM</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="571" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-1024x571.png" alt="Janna is one of the most underrated champions in League of Legends, and to be honest, we like it that way because nobody understands how truly powerful she is! Once you learn how to use her Q effectively, she's one of the best supports in the game. Here are the best runes for Janna in ARAM!" class="wp-image-10594" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-1024x571.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-300x167.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-768x428.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-1536x857.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-2048x1142.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-750x418.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-1140x636.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Arcane Comet</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Arcane Comet</strong>&nbsp;has been the default keystone option for Janna for a long time. This is the case in season 11 as well, primarily because Janna can spam its effect very easily thanks to her W. The applied slow helps her land the comet, and since Janna has only two damaging abilities, Arcane Comet is an excellent DPS boost for a support champion.</p>



<h3><strong>Manaflow Band</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Manaflow Band&nbsp;</strong>is here to fix Janna’s mana problem. The way this rune works is pretty simple, actually. Once in 15 seconds, you have the chance to both return your missing mana and to increase your maximum mana. And you only have to damage an enemy champion with either Q or W for it!</p>



<h3><strong>Transcendence</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Transcendence</strong>&nbsp;will add a bunch of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/difference-between-ability-haste-and-cooldown-reduction/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ability haste</a>&nbsp;to your kit and help you spam those tornados for the rest of the game. Combined with your item build, you’re looking at a very active Janna from start to end!</p>



<h3><strong>Gathering Storm</strong></h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Gathering Storm</strong>&nbsp;is the preferred rune for Janna in the last row of the Sorcery tree. Every 10 minutes, it gives you a bonus flat AP, which is an excellent way to build your damaging without spending gold for it.</p>



<h3><strong>Relentless Hunter</strong></h3>



<p>For secondary runes, you should go for Domination, and&nbsp;<strong>Relentless Hunter&nbsp;</strong>especially. Now, Janna is naturally a very speedy champion. But with a stacked-up Relentless Hunter, she practically flies over the map. Yes, the bonus cancels as soon as you enter combat, but it’s very useful when trying to reach your teammates when they need help.</p>



<h3><strong>Eyeball Collection</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Eyeball Collection</strong>&nbsp;is the only other rune choice that significantly helps Janna. It passively builds her AP without any effort. So you only have to pick up before the game starts and forget about it.</p>



<h2><strong>Bonuses</strong></h2>



<p>The choice for bonuses is the easiest of all. Two&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Adaptive Forces</strong></a>&nbsp;and one&nbsp;<strong>Armor / Magic Penetration</strong>&nbsp;is the way to go in all ARAM games.</p>

<h3><strong>Imperial Mandate</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Imperial Mandate</strong>&nbsp;is the mythic item we mentioned at the start. It gives Janna all of her most important stats &#8211; ability power, ability haste, health, and mana regeneration. And it only costs 2500 gold, so you can purchase it on your first back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imperial Mandate will deal bonus magic damage to enemies when you use either Q or W against them. Plus, it increases the value of any AP item you buy next.</p>



<h3><strong>Ionian Boots of Lucidity</strong></h3>



<p>As for boots, Janna goes best with&nbsp;<strong>Ionian Boots of Lucidity</strong>. Her best stat is ability haste, and anything that increases it is more than welcome.</p>



<h3><strong>Ardent Censer</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Ardent Censer&nbsp;</strong>is part of Janna’s core item build in ARAM, as well as ranked and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-urf-runes/" rel="noreferrer noopener">URF</a>. It transforms her E and R into game-breaking boosts that benefit all your teammates, especially the marksmen champions.</p>



<h3><strong>Staff of Flowing Waters</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Staff of Flowing Waters</strong>&nbsp;provides a nice movement speed buff for Janna and her teammates every time she uses a shield or a heal. And it can be excellent for both running away and chasing down enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Redemption</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Redemption&nbsp;</strong>is a great way to double your healing potential as Janna. It’s another very cheap item that you can always purchase, which will help you keep your friends alive. Plus, you can use it while you’re dead!</p>



<h3><strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong></h3>



<p>And as for the last item, we highly suggest you go for <strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>. By the time you reach it, you’ll already have great utility with the rest of your build. Rabadon’s Deathcap will not only enhance your damage but your shields as well. Getting it can make you powerful enough to close the game on your own!</p>

<h2><strong>Soraka in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h2>



<p>Soraka is one of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-off-meta-supports/" rel="noreferrer noopener">best support champions</a>&nbsp;in ARAM in season 11, simply because her build is just too good at carrying games. You see, Soraka’s greatest strength isn’t in her damage potential nor her defensive stats. Instead, she can top her allies’ health bars from the beginning to the end of the game. This allows Soraka’s team to always be at an advantage, which results in her winning more games than the average player. So if you get Soraka in your champion select in ARAM in season 11, make sure to prepare the best build for her!</p>



<p>And the build that we’re going to elaborate on here focuses on Soraka’s true power &#8211; healing and sustain. Regardless if you’re going to play this champion aggressively or passively, we will teach you how to excel at playing Soraka. This guide will show you which items to purchase in which order, as well as which runes to pick up before even the match starts.</p>



<p>Before we jump into the actual build, though, please be aware of Soraka’s strongest and weakest points. As Soraka, you should never be able to 1v1 another champion &#8211; a fact! Yes, Soraka can do some great damage with a few AP items, but she is much better at staying behind and supporting her teammates while they do the hard work! Another thing is that Soraka is a very&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy champion</a>&nbsp;and usually gets a one-shot by the likes of Zed, Fizz, or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-zoe-aram-build/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoe</a>. So, you’ll be wise to stay behind and heal your allies!</p>



<p>With that said, let’s break down how to best build Soraka in ARAM in Season 11!</p>



<h2><strong>Best Build for Soraka in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h2><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>Summoner’s Spells are the first thing to decide in champion select. In ARAM, Soraka mainly favors three options:&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Heal</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>. And the choice between them is simple! While Flash stays as a default option, you switch between Heal and Clarity according to the situation at hand. If one or more people on your time have already picked up Clarity, then you select Heal. And vice versa!</p>



<h2><strong>Best runes for Soraka in ARAM</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="571" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-1024x571.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10572" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-1024x571.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-300x167.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-768x428.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-1536x857.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-2048x1142.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-750x418.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-1140x636.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3><strong>Summon Aery</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Summon Aery&nbsp;</strong>is the best offensive and defensive keystone for Soraka in any&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-featured-game-modes-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">League of Legends game mode</a>. It is a very flexible rune that provides useful utility all around. It does good damage when you hit a spell, and grants a nice shield when you heal an ally. Pretty helpful in both scenarios.</p>



<h3><strong>Manaflow Band</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Manaflow Band</strong>&nbsp;can be very OP if you know how to utilize it. The rune itself gives you a maximum of 25 mana when you hit an enemy champion, up to 250 mana. Then it no longer increases your mana, but instead gives you mana regeneration. It has a 15 seconds cooldown, which is great for a fast-paced game of ARAM. And if you didn’t know, you can track this cooldown on top of your HUD. So make sure to time your Qs every time Manaflow Band is available just so you get the most use out of it!</p>



<h3><strong>Transcendence&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Transcendence&nbsp;</strong>perfectly fits Soraka’s playstyle. It grants bonus ability haste as you level up, as well as cooldown reduction when you score a kill or an assist. And because Soraka’s success depends on her abilities, having them always ready is very crucial!</p>



<h3><strong>Scorch</strong></h3>



<p>In the last row of the Sorcery tree,&nbsp;<strong>Scorch</strong>&nbsp;is the best rune to consider. It helps tremendously with the damage in the early game, especially on Soraka. Plus, it has only 10 seconds cooldown, so you have a reason not to take it!</p>



<h3><strong>Revitalize</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>Revitalize&nbsp;</strong>is a very important rune that you should always pick up on Soraka. It boosts her heals and shields on targets below 40% HP. And because people are constantly fighting in ARAM, you’ll always have an ally below 40% HP that requires healing.</p>



<h3><strong>Bone Plating</strong></h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Bone Plating</strong>&nbsp;is an extremely good defensive choice for Soraka. It nullifies a potential one-shot from the enemy every 45 seconds, which can really ruin the experience of playing Soraka for you.</p>



<h3><strong>Bonuses</strong></h3>



<p>You want to take two&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Adaptive Forces</strong></a><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;plus an&nbsp;<strong>Armor/Magic Resist&nbsp;</strong>rune out of the bonuses as Soraka in ARAM.</p>



<h2><strong>Best items for Soraka in ARAM</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="571" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-1024x571.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10571" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-1024x571.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-300x167.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-768x428.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-1536x857.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-2048x1143.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-750x418.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-1140x636.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Moonstone Renewer</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Moonstone Renewer&nbsp;</strong>is without a doubt the best mythic item for Soraka in League of Legends. It works like this: when you enter combat, you heal your allies significantly more! And the longer you spend in combat, the more this effect stacks. In prolonged ARAM fights, this can be a real game-changer!</p>



<h3><strong>Ardent Censer</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Ardent Censer</strong>&nbsp;is the standard second item choice for Soraka. It grants bonus attack speed and magic damage to a healed ally, making them stronger. This item works well on all champions, and it’s a must in Soraka’s build.</p>



<h3><strong>Ionian Boots of Lucidity</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Ionian Boots of Lucidity&nbsp;</strong>are the best boots upgrades for Soraka. As we mentioned earlier, Soraka’s power relies on her always being ready to help out in a team fight, so the bonus ability haste from these boots is very valuable.</p>



<h3><strong>Redemption</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Redemption</strong>&nbsp;is another core item that you must always get on Soraka. It increases your HP and healing potential, as well as your&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/difference-between-ability-haste-and-cooldown-reduction/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ability haste</a>&nbsp;and mana regeneration. Plus, the active can turn the tide of a fight, and it’s usable while being dead!</p>



<h3><strong>Staff of Flowing Water</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Staff of Flowing Water</strong>&nbsp;is an extremely valuable item for Soraka. Whenever you heal a teammate, Staff of Flowing Water will grant you a movement speed bonus, which matches Soraka’s playstyle of constantly tending to wounded allies.</p>



<h3><strong>Warmog’s Armor</strong></h3>



<p>Near the end of the game, <strong>Warmog’s Armor</strong> will be the strongest purchase for this champion. Soraka’s heals take a portion of her HP, so having more HP means more healing! Additionally, the bonus health helps her stay around longer and assure the team’s victory!</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-lucian-aram-build/"><img width="800" height="100" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tesz-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10575" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tesz-1.png 800w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tesz-1-300x38.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tesz-1-768x96.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tesz-1-750x94.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></figure></div>

<h1><strong>Teemo in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h1>



<p>When it comes to Teemo in ARAM, season 11 is his time to shine! The little devil has recently received an indirect buff in the form of a patch note. In fact, Riot Games did remove the Oracle’s Extract potion, which made it possible for us to see invisible traps and champions. And Teemo is now unbeatable! There is almost nothing that can uncover him or his mushrooms, so nothing to counter him with! So if you want to know how to best build and play Teemo in ARAM in season 11, then you’ve come to the right place!</p>



<p>But, the “no counterplay” detail isn’t the only power spike that Teemo received in season 11! His go-to mythic item,&nbsp;<strong>Liandry’s Anguish</strong>, now not only boosts the damage of his R &#8211; Noxious Trap, but it also provides him with mana and ability haste! This is crucial for his&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/tips-for-better-early-game/" rel="noreferrer noopener">early game</a>&nbsp;strength because his Q &#8211; Blinding Dart becomes basically free to cast.</p>



<p>Teemo excels in every situation, really. He is good at hitting enemies from afar, and he is good in melee range. Hell, he doesn’t even have to appear on the map to kill you! With the right build, Teemo can take down&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy champions</a>&nbsp;from 1 to 2 well-placed mushrooms. As long as you follow this guide, you’ll be able to dominate your games, if not win them all! So let’s learn how to best build Teemo in ARAM in season 11!</p>



<h1><strong>Best Build for Teemo in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h1>



<h2><strong>Best runes for Teemo in ARAM</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="572" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-1024x572.png" alt="Teemo can be played in multiple different ways, but we feel like that the Dark Harvest keystone is the perfect rune for him in ARAM. Since ARAM is a fact-paced game mode, Teemo will be able to proc the Dark Harvest very fast, which will turn him in an unstoppable beast!" class="wp-image-10457" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-1024x572.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-768x429.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-1536x858.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-2048x1144.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-750x419.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-teemo-1140x637.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Dark Harvest</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Dark Harvest</strong>&nbsp;is the keystone you want to pick up on Teemo. Because ARAM is a much more chaotic and fast-paced&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-featured-game-modes-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">game mode</a>&nbsp;than ranked Summoner’s Rift, things like Dark Harvest stack exceptionally quickly. This just means that every time your enemies will step on one of your mushrooms, the initial burst will be almost tripled. And that plays a key part in doing as much damage as possible as Teemo in ARAM in season 11!</p>



<h3><strong>Cheap Shot</strong></h3>



<p>And the second mandatory rune is, of course,&nbsp;<strong>Cheap Shot</strong>. Cheap Shot adds true bonus damage to your traps, so it will maximize the potential of every individual mushroom. The crazy thing about it is that this rune has only 4 seconds cooldown. So by the time an enemy champion steps on the next trap, it will activate again!</p>



<h3><strong>Eyeball Collection</strong></h3>



<p>In the third row, we choose&nbsp;<strong>Eyeball Collection&nbsp;</strong>for two reasons. First, the other two runes are all about warding, which you can’t do in ARAM. And second, Eyeball Collection is the only damage increase. So it&#8217;s a nice buff to possess.</p>



<h3><strong>Ultimate Hunter</strong></h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Hunter</strong>&nbsp;just doubles the fun of playing Teemo in ARAM. With every kill or an assist you take, Ultimate Hunter will lower the cooldown of your R. The more enemies you slay, the more traps you can put out! And the more traps you can set, the more people you’re going to kill! Honestly, this is the best-performing rune for Teemo, and you’ll be wise to play with it!</p>



<h3><strong>Presence of Mind</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Presence of Mind</strong>&nbsp;will provide you with enough mana throughout the game. It boosts the mana regeneration during combat tenfold, while restoring 15% instantly after scoring an enemy takedown. This is a way too useful rune to pass out on, so make sure to select it.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Coup de Grace</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Coup de Grace&nbsp;</strong>plays a vital part in finishing off enemies. It will make you deal more damage to targets under 40% HP. In other words, no enemy will ever survive on 1 HP. Instead, you’ll be able to score those kills way more easily.</p>



<h3><strong>Bonuses</strong></h3>



<p>The bonuses are the easiest part of Teemo’s ARAM build in season 11. Two&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Adaptive Forces</strong></a>&nbsp;plus an&nbsp;<strong>Armor/Magic Resist&nbsp;</strong>rune will get the job done in almost every game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Best items for Teemo in ARAM</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="575" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-1024x575.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10456" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-1024x575.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-768x431.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-1536x862.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-2048x1150.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-750x421.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-aram-teemo-1140x640.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Liandry’s Anguish</strong></h3>



<p>As we mentioned above,&nbsp;<strong>Liandry’s Anguish</strong>&nbsp;is the only mythic item to consider on Teemo. It just completes his ability kit and the way he is supposed to be played. Once you complete the item, the passive burning becomes almost unplayable for any champion in the game. And unless they buy a bunch of magic resist, they’re going to melt away!</p>



<h3><strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes</strong></h3>



<p>And to help you out with the magic resist problem,&nbsp;<strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes</strong>&nbsp;will be your first choice. The amount of magic penetration they bring to the build is enough to last you to the late game. The upgrade is only 800 gold, so make sure to get it as soon as possible.</p>



<h3><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong></h3>



<p>The third best item for Teemo in ARAM is&nbsp;<strong>Demonic Embrace</strong>. This item is ridiculously strong against tanky champions. It burns them with damage based on their maximum health, so the more HP they purchase, the more damage you’re going to deal with them!</p>



<h3><strong>Morellonomicon</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Morellonomicon&nbsp;</strong>is your best friend when it comes to dealing with healing comps. And Teemo is excellent with it because the Grevious Wounds effect takes place as soon as his enemies step on his traps. So not only will they burn, but they will also not be able to heal the damage up!</p>



<h3><strong>Void Staff</strong></h3>



<p>As a fifth item,&nbsp;<strong>Void Staff</strong>&nbsp;will be the best option! By the time you reach this stage in the game, the chances are that your opponents will already have one or more magic resist items. So adding Void Staff will nullify their purchases and make you even deadlier!</p>



<h3><strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong></h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>&nbsp;is the ultimate item to end the game with! Adding it lastly on top of all that ability power is a massive power spike that makes it almost impossible for Teemo to lose. A well-placed mushrooms, and the game is yours!</p>



<h2><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>The first thing to take care of is Summoner’s Spells. For Teemo in ARAM,&nbsp;<strong>Flash&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Heal</strong>&nbsp;will always be the best choice. Flash is helpful in every scenario, and it’s a mandatory spell in League of Legends. And no other choice performs better than Heal since Teemo has no need for mana regen or slow effects, for example.</p>

<h1><strong>Vel’Koz in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h1>



<p>Welcome to our guide on how to best build Vel’Koz in ARAM in season 11 of League of Legends! Here we will take a look at which&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-get-more-league-of-legends-rune-pages/" rel="noreferrer noopener">runes</a>&nbsp;you should pick up before every game, as well as which items you should buy while you’re playing. If you’ve never mastered Vel’Koz as a champion or you have never given him a chance, now is the time to do so!</p>



<p>In truth, Vel’Koz is one of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">strongest champions</a>&nbsp;that you can get in ARAM, and here is why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First of all, Vel’Koz possesses an unbelievable amount of damage! His passive &#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Organic Deconstruction</strong>&nbsp;gives him a true damage effect, something that most other mage champions simply lack. All of his active abilities have an incredible amount of range, making him a very safe pick for all sorts of situations! And not to mention the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a>&nbsp;through his Q and E!</p>



<p>Among the few weak points to playing Vel’Koz is that of his defensiveness. He is a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy champion</a>&nbsp;and a very easy one to eliminate once enemies get close enough. Plus, his abilities require at least some skill at aiming in League of Legends, and if you aren’t great at this, Vel’Koz may feel very underwhelming to you.</p>



<p>However, skill shots can be practiced and mastered. The important thing to understand here is that if you give Vel’Koz a chance, you can truly become seriously dangerous in LoL. But, you won’t become truly OP without the best build for Vel’Koz in ARAM in season 11!</p>



<h1><strong>Best Build for Vel’Koz in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h1>



<h2><strong>Best runes for Vel&#8217;Koz in ARAM</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="574" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-1024x574.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10332" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-1024x574.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-768x431.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-1536x861.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-2048x1148.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-750x421.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram-1140x639.png 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-velkoz-aram.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3>Arcane Comet</h3>



<p>Vel’Koz’s real strength comes from his poking. Since his abilities have such a long-range, your mission is to spam them as much as possible, at least in ARAM.&nbsp;<strong>Arcane Comet</strong>&nbsp;fits perfectly into this idea by providing one more poking tool. The actual comet is very easy to hit since Vel’Koz’s Q has a slow effect attached.</p>



<h3>Manaflow Band</h3>



<p><strong>Manaflow Band</strong>&nbsp;is an absolute must-have rune for Vel’Koz. It provides an insane amount of mana and mana regeneration, which is more than enough to get you through the early game.</p>



<h3>Transcendence</h3>



<p>Like many mages, Vel’Koz becomes a beast with the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/difference-between-ability-haste-and-cooldown-reduction/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ability haste</a>. The more of it you acquire, the more frequently you can throw your spells and destroy your opponents! Well,&nbsp;<strong>Transcendence&nbsp;</strong>is a free ability haste buff that you benefit from throughout the game, so always pick it up!</p>



<h3>Gathering Storm</h3>



<p><strong>Gathering Storm</strong>&nbsp;isn’t the most useful rune in ARAM since it slowly builds your power and the games aren’t usually 40 minutes long. However, it is very strong on Vel’Koz because he needs every bit of AP that he could get. Vel’Koz’s abilities scale exceptionally well with ability power, so any source is highly appreciated!</p>



<h3>Eyeball Collection</h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Eyeball Collection</strong>&nbsp;is chosen for the same exact purposes! It is among the few other runes that provide flat AP since the start of the game, so we always select it!</p>



<h3>Relentless Hunter</h3>



<p>The next best rune in the Domination tree for Vel’Koz is&nbsp;<strong>Relentless Hunter</strong>. Since Vel’Koz doesn’t have any movement ability, the flat movement speed makes him a viable champion to play. If you feel like you won’t need a lot of peeling, then&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Hunter</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong>&nbsp;might be good options too.</p>



<h2><strong>Bonuses</strong></h2>



<p>The bonus runes for Vel’Koz in ARAM never change. Two&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Adaptive Force</strong></a>&nbsp;runes should always be locked in whenever you get this champion, as well as an&nbsp;<strong>Armor</strong>&nbsp;rune for defensiveness!</p>



<h2><strong>Best items for Vel&#8217;Koz in ARAM</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="575" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-1024x575.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10331" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-1024x575.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-768x431.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-1536x863.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-2048x1150.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-750x421.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram-1140x640.png 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-items-for-velkoz-in-aram.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3>Luden’s Tempest</h3>



<p>The mythic item that pairs the best with Vel’Koz’s playstyle is&nbsp;<strong>Luden’s Tempest</strong>. This item is seriously nuts when you take into consideration that it boosts all of Vel’Koz’s aspects! It provides him with mana and mana regeneration, then ability haste, and then extra AOE damage whenever he hits an enemy for the first time. This is such a crucial part of Vel’Koz’s build that no one can imagine playing this champion without it!</p>



<h3>Sorcerer’s Shoes</h3>



<p><strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes</strong>&nbsp;are the strongest boots upgrades for Vel’Koz because of the magic penetration. You’re going to need it as much as possible for closing the game, especially against tanky team composition.</p>



<h3>Demonic Embrace</h3>



<p><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong>&nbsp;is the next core to Vel’Koz’s build. It burns enemies based on their maximum HP and can be an insane source of damage throughout the game. And because Vel’Koz can spam his abilities left and right, it is very easy for him to get the full benefit out of this item.</p>



<h3>Morellonomicon</h3>



<p><strong>Morellonomicon</strong>&nbsp;is a scary addition to Vel’Koz’s power. Draining enemy champions without giving them the option to heal can give you some free wins when you play this champion. The Grievous Wounds effect is simply too valuable to pass on on any mage, so always purchase Morellonomicon!</p>



<h3>Zhonya’s Hourglass</h3>



<p><strong>Zhonya’s Hourglass</strong>&nbsp;is the first defensive option that Vel’Koz should get. The Stasis active is extremely useful in all sorts of situations, allowing you to outplay your opponents every 2 minutes. It also provides you with armor, ability power, and ability haste, which are some of the most needed stats for Vel’Koz!</p>



<h3>Rabadon’s Deathcap</h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>&nbsp;is the last item that you should get as Vel’Koz. It’s very good for closing out games since it almost doubles your AP and thus lets you win team fights more easily. It’s also very easy to purchase this item in ARAM, so make sure you do it every game!</p>



<h2><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>The best Summoner’s Spells choices for Vel’Koz in ARAM are&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Heal</strong>. Flash is absolutely a necessary part of playing immobile champions like Vel’Koz. And Heal helps you with staying alive since Vel’Koz doesn’t have any defensive ability. However, you can opt for&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>&nbsp;if you have supports like Soraka in your team!</p>

<h1><strong>Maokai in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h1>



<p>Welcome to our guide on how to play Maokai in ARAM! Here we will lay out for you the best build for Maokai in ARAM in season 11, as well as some additional tips and things to do every game. Maokai doesn’t have a very strict build path, but he does need some items more than others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being primarily a tank, Maokai benefits the most from the defensive items, such as&nbsp;<strong>Spirit Visage</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Thornmail</strong>. However, he is also an AP based champion, and his abilities can be quite devastating if you put a bit of power into them. So you’ll be wise to also consider getting offensive items as well.</p>



<p>Maokai’s main strength comes from his ability to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/list-of-crowd-control-abilities-and-the-3-best-crowd-control-champions/" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a>&nbsp;his enemies while healing a significant portion of the damage he is taking and peeling for his teammates. He is one of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/9-easiest-league-of-legends-champions-to-learn/" rel="noreferrer noopener">easiest champions</a>&nbsp;to maneuver, and his abilities are fairly easy to set up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only underwhelming feeling you can get when playing Maokai is the&nbsp;lack of damage. However, we will show you how to eliminate this problem by purchasing a bit of ability power and then stomping your enemies. And with that said, let’s jump into the best build for Maokai in ARAM in season 11!</p>



<h1><strong>Best Build for Maokai in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h1>



<h2><strong>Best Runes for Maokai in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="573" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-maokai-1024x573.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10276" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-maokai-1024x573.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-maokai-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-maokai-768x430.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-maokai-1536x859.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-maokai-2048x1146.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-maokai-750x420.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-maokai-1140x638.png 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-runes-for-aram-maokai.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Aftershock</h2>



<p><strong>Aftershock</strong>&nbsp;is the standard keystone choice for Maokai in ARAM. The rune has a powerful offensive and defensive effect that activates when you&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>&nbsp;an enemy champion. So when you root someone as Moakai, Aftershock will give you bonus armor and magic resist, but it will also explode after 2.5 seconds and deal massive amounts of damage. This is very helpful in all situations!</p>



<h2>Font of Life</h2>



<p><strong>Font of Life</strong>&nbsp;can be an incredible source of healing for your whole team. The rune works like this: when you root an enemy champion, that champion gets marked for 4 seconds. During these 4 seconds, any ally that attacks the marked champion will heal himself for up to 4.5% of their maximum HP, which is pretty handy.</p>



<h2>Conditioning</h2>



<p><strong>Conditioning</strong>&nbsp;is a lovely safe card for Maokai in case he falls behind during the game. After 12 minutes, the rune grants you bonus armor and magic resist, equal to almost one complete item. This is an extremely useful rune, so make sure to prioritize it!</p>



<h2>Revitalize</h2>



<p>Maokai is very good at self-healing.&nbsp;<strong>Revitalize</strong>&nbsp;boosts this strength and also grants you bonus healing from additional sources, such as ally champions. It is a very helpful rune overall and considered a must for Maokai in&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-featured-game-modes-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">League of Legends&#8217; game modes</a>.</p>



<h2>Triumph</h2>



<p>Moving over to the Precision tree,&nbsp;<strong>Triumph</strong>&nbsp;is the first rune to pick up! It is one more healing source for Maokai that activates every time he scores a kill or an assist. And because fights are constantly going on in ARAM, you can get a lot of value out of this rune.</p>



<h2>Legend: Tenacity</h2>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Legend: Tenacity</strong>&nbsp;is the last rune you’ll need as Maokai. It helps you tremendously with moving freely because it removes your enemies&#8217; ability to control you. It builds up as you gather kills and assists, so it’s very easy to stack up.</p>



<h2>Bonuses</h2>



<p>As for the bonuses, Moakai’s mostly favors this combination: two&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Adaptive Forces</strong></a>&nbsp;and an&nbsp;<strong>Armor</strong>&nbsp;rune.</p>



<h2><strong>Best Items for Maokai in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="575" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-1024x575.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10275" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-1024x575.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-768x431.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-1536x862.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-2048x1149.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-750x421.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM-1140x640.png 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-item-build-for-maokai-in-ARAM.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h2>Sunfire Aegis</h2>



<p>By now, it’s no secret that&nbsp;<strong>Sunfire Aegis</strong>&nbsp;is seriously broken in League of Legends. Maokai benefits a lot from the basic stats it brings to the table, but the passive is where all the true strength lies. You see, Sunfire Aegis burns down enemies around you whenever you deal or take damage. This effect stacks multiple times, and it’s very OP. And since it’s very easy for Maokai to get in range with the enemy carries, it makes Sunfire Aegis the strongest mythic item for him!</p>



<h2>Mercury’s Treads</h2>



<p><strong>Mercury’s Treads</strong>&nbsp;are the single-best boots upgrades for Maokai. They give additional resistance to crowd control effects, and combined with Legend: Tenacity, you’ll completely nullify your enemies’ CC potential.</p>



<h2>Demonic Embrace</h2>



<p><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong>&nbsp;is the first offensive purchase for Maokai in ARAM. This item synergizes with Sunfire aegis by adding one more source of burning down enemies. Combined, they can drain any champion in just a few seconds, and they work super well on Maokai!</p>



<h2>Spirit Visage</h2>



<p><strong>Spirit Visage&nbsp;</strong>is a core item to Maokai’s defensiveness. It’s not only good against a heavy AP team, but all around. The passive increases your healing from all sources by 25%, which is really high! And even with Grievous Wounds against you, you’ll still do a tremendous amount of healing.</p>



<h2>Thornmail</h2>



<p><strong>Thornmail</strong>&nbsp;is one of the best tank items in League of Legends and a must-have for Maokai too. The primary reason for purchasing it is to increase your base armor, but the Thorns passive is incredible as well. It damages people when they auto attack you, so you should always try to purchase it, especially against multiple marksman champions.</p>



<h2>Morellonomicon</h2>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Morellonomicon</strong>&nbsp;is a great item to finish the game with. Being able to sustain nearly all damage while giving the enemy no option to do the same is a recipe for victory in ARAM.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>The best combination of Summoner’s Spells for Maokai in ARAM is&nbsp;<strong>Flash&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Mark</strong>. Flash is pretty much a must in League of Legends, and&nbsp;<strong>Mark</strong>&nbsp;fits very well with Maokai’s playstyle. If you can get good snowballs, you’ll be able to instantly root enemies and win team fights!</p>

<p><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-does-mmr-work/" data-type="post" data-id="8291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MMR</a> is simply a match-making rating in League of Legends. Its origins go back to at least season 2 and season 3 of League of Legends. A similar method of rating is also used in many other games as well including basketball. Riot didn’t actually start a ranked-tier system for the Howling Abyss where the League of Legends game mode ARAM is played. Instead, the ranked system began for ranked matches played in the Summoner’s Rift. The term “<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/which-ranks-are-considered-as-high-elo-ones-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high elo</a>” comes from meaning high rank in the League of Legends Tier system.</p>



<p>Accordingly, higher-ranked players are matched up with players at a similarly ranked tier to ensure competition remains healthy. Thus it seems MMR is only for matches played in the Summoner’s Rift.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Is there MMR for ARAM as well?</strong></h2>



<p>However, many players have reported being faced with more formidable or more accessible opponents in the ARAM mode as well. This must mean that there some logic to how players are matched in ARAM as well. The MMR number represents a league of legends player’s skill level. It determines the opponents you play against. If you are new, it’s likely that you won’t be matched against higher-skilled players. Although players often use ARAM mode to warm up for Summoner’s Rift, which is the primary game mode for League of Legends, ARAM itself can be very challenging and fun to play.</p>

<h2><strong>MMR is different for Queue types:</strong></h2>



<p>Your ARAM match-making rating will be different from your Summoner’s Rift rating. You can’t expect to win ARAM matches in a series and then expect to have a higher MMR for the classic 5v5 game as well. Similarly, your solo Q rating will be different from than duo queue rating. If you have a 5-member squad, playing with this team will affect your MMR in another way. So don’t start thinking if you are good at 5v5 in the Summoner’s Rift, then you are automatically entitled to play the best players in ARAM as well. The rating for each queue type and for each game mode is different for you. There is an entire match-making guide on the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games’ website</a>&nbsp;if you want to know more in detail.</p>



<h2><strong>How is MMR related to ELO?</strong></h2>



<p>Ranked game modes use the League Points or LP in addition to the MMOR to rank players. Your MMR and the average MMR of your tier/division determine your Elo in ranked matches. If you are on an unbeatable winning strike, then it means you are playing better than the average MMR for your tier, and you will get more LP per match. Conversely, if you start losing games, it will mean you are playing below the average MMR for your tier, and you lost more LP points.</p>

<h2><strong>How to check MMR for ARAM?</strong></h2>



<p>Although MMR records and ratings are kept internal to Riot Games, various fan-made tools can help you find your own MMR. One of the tools is&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://na.whatismymmr.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://na.whatismymmr.com/</a>, which explains what MMR is and its relation to Elo. You have to have played in the last 30 days to get an MMR rating. This tool is not available in all servers yet, unfortunately. Similarly, the website&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://aram.academy/" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://aram.academy/</a>&nbsp;offers a very extensive guide into ARAM and how to improve your performance in this game mode. Both these websites are fan-made. Riot had no part to play in this.</p>

<h2>Viktor in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>



<p>Unlike in the past, Viktor is currently one of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-solo-queue-champions-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8813">best champions to dominate season </a>11, especially in ARAM. Riot Games have reworked his passive, and Viktor no longer requires an external item to boost his damage. All he needs is a&nbsp;<strong>Luden’s Tempest</strong>&nbsp;to start one-shotting people left and right.</p>



<p>Viktor isn’t the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/the-most-difficult-league-of-legends-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8685">hardest champion to master</a>, and after a couple of games, you’re going to feel comfortable with him. He has an extremely useful kit that lets him do damage but also to survive prolonged fights. He runs fast, bursts often, and is overall an excellent team-oriented champion!</p>



<p>The only negative side to playing Viktor is that he is an immobile champion. It can be very easy for him to fall into the enemy’s hands or get overrun. So positioning smartly is a crucial part, as well as getting alternative mobility options from his build.</p>



<p>So if you’re interested in playing Viktor in ARAM in season 11, then you’ve come to the right place to get the best build possible! Here we will take a look at the rune choices, item paths, spells, and all the additional tips and tricks that you’re going to need.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Best Build for Viktor in ARAM in Season 11</h1>



<h3>Summoner’s Spells</h3>



<p>In ARAM, Viktor goes best with&nbsp;<strong>Flash&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Mark</strong>. Flash helps you with literally everything and is a great offensive and defensive tool. And Mark allows you to reach your targets since Viktor doesn’t have the biggest ability range.</p>



<p>But, know that&nbsp;<strong>Ghost</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>&nbsp;are both viable options in certain situations. If the enemy team has a lot of tanks and you need to kite, then Ghost will be the better choice. And if no one on your team has Clarity, then the extra mana might prove necessary for the early game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Best Runes for Viktor in ARAM</h2>

There are usually more kills in ARAM games than in Summoner Rift ones, which means that Dark Harvest is the best rune path for Viktor in ARAM. We've explained why each of these runes is the perfect choice for him, and we sincerely believe that you can't go wrong if you choose to follow our guide!" class="wp-image-9958" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-1024x574.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-768x430.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-1536x861.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-2048x1147.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-192x108.png 192w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-384x216.png 384w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-364x205.png 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-728x409.png 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-561x314.png 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-1122x629.png 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-608x341.png 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-758x426.png 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-1152x645.png 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram-313x175.png 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/best-runes-for-viktor-in-aram.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Dark Harvest</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Dark Harvest</strong>&nbsp;is the single-best keystone for ARAM, and Viktor benefits significantly from it. Since you’re going to fight 99% of the time, you’re going to collect a lot of souls. Each stack significantly increases Viktor’s burst potential. And with enough stacks, Viktor becomes really deadly. One E &#8211; Q combo is enough to delete anyone from Howling Fjord!</li></ul>



<h3>Taste of Blood</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Taste of Blood&nbsp;</strong>plays a vital part in Viktor’s survivability. Every 10 seconds, this rune heals you passively as you deal your damage. It’s really a no-brainer because neither&nbsp;<strong>Sudden Impact</strong>&nbsp;nor&nbsp;<strong>Cheap Shot</strong>&nbsp;can give Viktor as much value as&nbsp;<strong>Taste of Blood</strong>&nbsp;can.</li></ul>



<h3>Eyeball Collection</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Eyeball Collection&nbsp;</strong>is the only damage increase in the third row of the Domination tree. The other two options have to deal with wards and visibility, which in ARAM is practically non-existent. With Eyeball Collection, you’ll be able to boost your AP and reach your power spikes faster.</li></ul>



<h3>Ravenous Hunter</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Ravenous Hunter&nbsp;</strong>is the most powerful last-row choice for Viktor. This rune provides an insane amount of healing if you manage to stack it up quickly. Every kill or assist grant you a stack, so it’s vital to start fighting early on. And paired with Taste of Blood, Ravenous Hunter can be the cornerstone of Viktor’s power throughout the game.</li></ul>



<h3>Presence of Mind</h3>



<ul><li>And&nbsp;<strong>Presence of Mind</strong>&nbsp;is almost the equivalent to Ravenous Hunter. But where Ravenous Hunter heals your HP, Presence of Mind regenerates your mana as you deal damage. We honestly think that this rune is broken, and if not in ranked, then at least on ARAM because it’s totally possible to go the whole game on 100% mana.</li></ul>



<h3>Coup de Grace</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Coup de Grace</strong>&nbsp;is the only other rune that is worth picking up on Viktor. It gives you an 8% damage increase against targets below 40% HP. That simply means that you’re constantly going to deal 8% more damage since everyone is always fighting in ARAM.</li></ul>



<h2>Bonuses</h2>



<ul><li>For bonuses, you want to get two&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" data-type="post" data-id="9325">Adaptive Forces</a></strong>&nbsp;so you can maximize your DPS at the start of the game. And depending on the type of comp you’re facing, pick up an&nbsp;<strong>Armor</strong>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<strong>Magic Resistant</strong>&nbsp;rune.</li></ul>



<h2>Best Items for Viktor in ARAM</h2>

<h3>1. Luden’s Tempst</h3>



<ul><li>The first item that you need to take care of as Viktor in ARAM is, of course,&nbsp;<strong>Luden’s Tempest</strong>. This item is the best choice for any mage, especially Viktor. The amount of raw power, mana regen, and the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/difference-between-ability-haste-and-cooldown-reduction/" data-type="post" data-id="9901">ability haste</a> it provides are honestly too valuable to miss. And immediately after purchasing Luden’s Tempest, Viktor can start taking over games on his own.</li></ul>



<h3>2. Sorcerer’s Shoes</h3>



<ul><li>After purchasing Ludens’s echo, the smartest option is to upgrade your boots.&nbsp;<strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes</strong>&nbsp;are your best friend because they bring more than enough magic penetration for the early and the mid-game.</li></ul>



<h3>3. Lich Bane</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Lich Bane</strong>&nbsp;is an incredible power spike on Viktor, so always aim to get it as fast as possible. It synergizes exceptionally well with his Q &#8211; Siphon Power and adds a lot of value to Viktor’s one-shot potential. Almost all of Viktor’s abilities are in the auto-attack range, so you won’t have any trouble proccing the effect.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>Zhonyas’s Hourglass</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Zhonya’s Hourglass</strong>&nbsp;is your only viable defensive item as Viktor. The flat Armor helps a lot against a full AD team, and the active is literally a life-saver. And remember that you can buy&nbsp;<strong>Stopwatch&nbsp;</strong>separately and double the value of the Stasis.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3><strong>5. Morellonomicon</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Morellonomicon&nbsp;</strong>is an awesome item that allows you to defeat the tanks and the healers in League of Legends. The Grievous Wounds debuff can be crucial against such comps, so make sure to pick it up in every game.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>6. Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong></h3>



<ul><li>And for the end, we have&nbsp;<strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>. You essentially want to buy this item for closing the game since your damage numbers will skyrocket, and you’ll be able to shift+delete anyone.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Optional item</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Void Staff</strong>&nbsp;can also be an excellent choice if you already have enough AP but lack the magic penetration to melt your opponents.</li></ul>

<h2>Zoe in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>



<p>Zoe is the kind of champion in League of Legends that you can go all nuts with. Whether it’s high damage or long-range, Zoe takes the crown as one of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">greatest champions to carry</a>&nbsp;Howling Fjord games with. What we’re going to discuss here will help you understand how to best build Zoe in ARAM in season 11, as well as play and master her to always win.</p>



<p><em>But first of all, why is Zoe so strong in ARAM?</em></p>



<p>Well, one reason &#8211; one-shot! You see, Zoe’s ability kit perfectly fits the craziness of ARAM. Zoe usually hits outside of her enemies’ visibility, thanks to her Q &#8211; Paddle Star and her R &#8211; Portal Jump. On top of that, her E &#8211; Sleepy Trouble Bubble can travel from base to base if you cast it vertically along the two main walls of Howling Fjord. And not to mention that Zoe grabs all Summoner’s Spells and items for free to either damage or heal herself!</p>



<p>All of this combined makes Zoe one of the deadliest and the safest champions to play in League of Legends. An experienced Zoe player would never put himself in real danger, while at the same time, he would destroy everyone on the map. This is the biggest strength of Zoe, and here we’re going to teach you how to take advantage of that by getting the best build specifically for ARAM in season 11. Let’s go!</p>



<h1>Best Build for Zoe in ARAM in Season 11</h1>



<h2>Summoner’s Spells</h2>



<p>Since you will be taking everyone else’s Summoner’s Spells,&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Ignite</strong>&nbsp;are the best ones for Zoe. Flash is here to get you out of trouble or to increase the range/damage of your Q, while Ignite will finish off opponents.</p>



<h2>Best Runes for Zoe on ARAM</h2>

<h3>Dark Harvest</h3>



<ul><li>As Zoe, you would typically go something like Electrocute or Summon Aery in ranked games. But in ARAM,&nbsp;<strong>Dark Harvest</strong>&nbsp;is by far the best-performing keystone on this champion. If you’re only decent at skill shots, you’re going to collect a lot of souls. This will help you stack your potential and ultimately start one-shotting people only 10 minutes in the game!</li></ul>



<h3>Taste of Blood</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Taste of Blood&nbsp;</strong>is an excellent rune because Zoe is one of the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/">easiest champions to kill</a>, really. Besides her E, she doesn’t have any other defensive ability to protect herself if enemies come close to her. So, any healing you get out of your damaging spells is a huge bonus!</li></ul>



<h3>Eyeball Collection</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Eyeball Collection&nbsp;</strong>is the rune we choose in the third row of the Domination page, simply because it’s the only damage increase one. The rune stacks by slaying enemy champions, which you’re going to do anyway in ARAM, so it’s an awesome rune to have!</li></ul>



<h3>Ravenous Hunter</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong>&nbsp;plays the same role as Taste of Blood. It boosts Zoe’s survivability and gives her a way to heal up when she gets close to dying. The best thing about it is that the healing happens through your damaging spells. So not only you don’t have to stop your DPS, but you will regenerate health thanks to it!</li></ul>



<h3>Presence of Mind</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Presence of Mind</strong>&nbsp;is the favorite rune of any mage, including Zoe! It significantly boosts your mana regeneration up to the point where your early game is secured. Plus, with every champion takedown, Presence of Mind restores 15% of your mana. And because kills happen all the time in ARAM, you can see why this rune is mandatory!</li></ul>



<h3>Coup de Grace</h3>



<ul><li>And&nbsp;<strong>Coup de Grace&nbsp;</strong>is the second-best rune in the Precision tree. It increases your power against targets below 40% HP, which is fantastic for securing kills.</li></ul>



<h3>Bonuses</h3>

<h3>1. Luden’s Tempest</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Luden’s Tempest</strong>&nbsp;is the first must-have item we’re looking at for Zoe in ARAM. As a mythic item, it outperforms every other choice by far. It boosts Zoe’s first hit every 10 seconds and gives her an AOE effect. This helps her do more damage with only one ability and also have an easier time when collecting souls for Dark Harvest.</li></ul>



<h3>2. Sorcerer’s Shoes</h3>



<ul><li>For a second item upgrade, it’s<strong>&nbsp;</strong>always good to go for&nbsp;<strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes</strong>. The extra magic penetration adds a lot of power to Zoe’s kit in the early game, especially if the enemy team doesn’t have much magic resist. It allows her to essentially melt enemy champions with her base abilities.</li></ul>



<h3>3. Horizon Focus</h3>



<ul><li>Next, we have&nbsp;<strong>Horizon Focus</strong>. This item honestly looks like it’s made specifically for Zoe. Every time you hit someone over 750 range, that enemy is then revealed and takes more damage from you! So every time you land your Sleepy Trouble Bubble through a wall or your Paddle Star together with Portal Jump, you obliterate everyone on the other end!</li></ul>



<h3>4. Lich Bane</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Lich Bane</strong>&nbsp;is the fourth-best item for Zoe in ARAM. Thanks to its passive, you’ll be able to destroy Turrets and secure victories faster. Also, combined with Zoe’s passive &#8211; More Sparkles, her auto-attack can deal as much damage as an ability!</li></ul>



<h3>5. Rabadon’s Deathcap</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>&nbsp;is a core item in Zoe’s build. It is best to be bought later in the game when you’ve already stacked on a bit of AP. Rabadon’s then will almost double your amount and make you a real death machine! So never forget to pick it up!</li></ul>



<h3>6. Void Staff</h3>



<ul><li>And lastly, we have&nbsp;<strong>Void Staff</strong>. Unless your enemy team is full of tanks, Sorcerer’s Shoes will give you enough magic penetration for the first part of the game. However, when they start building MR, it’s almost mandatory for you to purchase Void Staff on Zoe. It keeps people away, and it helps you secure kills. So always buy it!</li></ul>

<h2>Ziggs in ARAM in Season 11</h2>



<p>Ziggs is one of the best champions to carry a game of ARAM with in season 11. His build revolves around dealing heavy AOE damage while staying out of trouble the whole time. Ziggs’ abilities aren’t the easiest to hit, but they have both the range and reach. That makes him one of the safest and scariest champions in League of Legends. Because who cares if you just missed a few bombs when you have thousands more to throw?</p>



<p>Here we will discuss the best item build, rune choices, and everything else that you need to know to own the ARAM scene as Ziggs in season 11. Know that this guide will apply to Summoner’s Rift and ranked games too. However, it’s designed primarily to give you the optimal outcome in an ARAM game by providing you with the most amount of damage and utility to carry your team. So, let’s begin!</p>



<h2>Summoner’s Spells</h2>



<p>For Ziggs, you want to pick up&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>&nbsp;as Summoner’s Spells. Flash is mandatory for almost any champion and game mode. It’s a necessary button for either escaping or scoring a kill.</p>



<p>Clarity helps tremendously with mana regeneration, especially in the first 10 minutes of the game. However, if one or two of your teammates have also selected Clarity as one of their spells, then&nbsp;<strong>Heal,&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Barrier</strong>&nbsp;will be your best choice. Or just pick up&nbsp;<strong>Mark</strong>&nbsp;and go all-in!</p>



<h2>Best Runes for Ziggs in ARAM</h2>

<h3>Dark Harvest</h3>



<ul><li>When it comes to ARAM,&nbsp;<strong>Dark Harvest</strong>&nbsp;is the king! Ziggs has numerous ways to proc its effect since his damage never really stops. Collecting souls is one of the easiest things that you can do because every one of your abilities flies over half the map and has a very wide hitbox. And with enough stacks, you have a pretty good chance of one-shotting any squishy champion in the game!</li></ul>



<h3>Taste of Blood</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Taste of Blood</strong>&nbsp;is the preferred choice in the second row of the Domination tree. It gives you a way to regenerate your missing health every 20 seconds, which is quite handy in ARAM. Ziggs is essentially a squishy champion himself, and every poke is a threat to his life.</li></ul>



<h3>Eyeball Collection</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Eyeball Collection</strong>&nbsp;is simply the best third-row option.&nbsp;<strong>Ghost Poro</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Zombie Ward</strong>&nbsp;are pretty useless in ARAM since no one can buy wards nor stay in a brush for a longer period of time. Eyeball Collection boosts your damage up a bit, so make sure to have it selected!</li></ul>



<h3>Ravenous Hunter</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong>&nbsp;completes Taste of Blood. Combined, they can give you significant health regeneration while dealing damage! Ravenous Hunter stacks with kills and assists, which is very easy to do in ARAM. You could go&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Hunter</strong>&nbsp;if you want, but Ziggs has more than enough damage without it, while little to none defensive options.</li></ul>



<h3>Presence of Mind</h3>



<ul><li>The only reason why you want to go for Precision as secondary runes is&nbsp;<strong>the Presence of Mind</strong>. This rune is nuts on its own, but in ARAM, it reaches new heights of broken! The amount of mana you can regenerate is enough to get you from the beginning to the end of the game without any other mana source! And more mana means more damage!</li></ul>



<h3>Coup de Grace</h3>



<ul><li>And&nbsp;<strong>Coup de Grace</strong>&nbsp;is an excellent finisher to pick up along the way. It synergizes very well with Dark Harvest and enhances your one-shot potential!</li></ul>



<h3>Bonuses</h3>



<ul><li>There aren’t many options when it comes to choosing bonuses for Ziggs. So two&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" data-type="post" data-id="9325">Adaptive Forces</a></strong>&nbsp;will be a standard pickup. And depending on the opponent you’re facing, one&nbsp;<strong>Armor&nbsp;</strong>or one&nbsp;<strong>Magic Resist</strong>&nbsp;is enough to get you going!</li></ul>



<h2>Best Items for Ziggs in ARAM</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="726" height="642" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48.png" alt="Even though he's not a very popular champion, Ziggs can really make a difference and carry his team to victory on ARAM. If you choose the right items, Ziggs can deal a massive AOE damage with his abilities. Here's the best items for Ziggs on ARAM." class="wp-image-9934" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48.png 726w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48-300x265.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48-561x496.png 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48-364x322.png 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48-608x538.png 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Slika-zaslona-2020-12-18-u-22.59.48-313x277.png 313w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></figure>



<h3>Luden’s Tempest</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Luden’s Tempest</strong>&nbsp;is the next thing that synergizes greatly with both Dark Harvest and Ziggs as a champion. The active echo helps you gather souls quickly while pumping your DPS every 10 seconds. The item is built with&nbsp;<strong>Lost Chapter</strong>, which is the best starting item for Ziggs in League of Legends overall.</li></ul>



<h3>Sorcerer’s Shoes</h3>



<ul><li>Upgrading your boots to&nbsp;<strong>Sorcerer’s Shoes&nbsp;</strong>early is a very good idea, especially if you’re ahead. The extra magic penetration will help you stay on top of your game and stop every opponent from doing the same.</li></ul>



<h3>Demonic Embrace</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong>&nbsp;is the best choice for a third item for two reasons: damage and price! This item significantly boosts your DPS output by not only giving you flat AP, but a passive that burns enemies for 1.2 max Health magic damage. And it only costs 3000 gold, which you can quickly gather with a couple of kills.</li></ul>



<h3>Morellonomicon</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Morellonomicon&nbsp;</strong>is your friend when it comes to dealing with healing comps. It can be pretty tough to stop all the passive healing that’s going on in season 11 of League of Legends, but Morellonomicon comes pretty close. And we recommend you to always purchase it on Ziggs!</li></ul>



<h3>Rabadon’s Deathcap</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>&nbsp;is the next best thing for Ziggs. The item has only one job &#8211; to maximize your damage potential. Ziggs scales extremely well with raw AP, so getting Rabadon’s Deathcap is a must for him!</li></ul>



<h3>Void Staff</h3>



<ul><li>And&nbsp;<strong>Void Staff</strong>&nbsp;is the best item to finish a game with. The amount of power it will add to your ability is incredibly crazy. The magic penetration will help you melt tanks and delete squishy champions from Howling Fjord! So always aim to get Void Staff as Ziggs on ARAM!</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Mordekaiser in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h2>



<p>If you want to learn the best build for Mordekaiser in ARAM in season 11, then you’ve come to the right place! Mordekaiser is an extremely <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-hyper-carries/" data-type="post" data-id="9744">powerful champion</a> that can 1v5 matches as you know what to do with him. Here we will take a deep dive on which items and runes are must-haves for Mordekaiser in ARAM in Season 11, as well as talk about some of his true strengths.</p>



<p>When it comes to Mordekaiser and Howling Fjord, his playstyle isn’t too different from ranked Summoner’s Rift. Being an AP melee champion, Mordekaiser’s power requires some setup. The main thing to master is his E &#8211; Death’s Grasp. This ability has a fairly long cooldown during the early game, so you don’t want to waste it on the minions.</p>



<p>Mordekaiser’s W &#8211; Indestructible, gives him a shield and heal, which are essential for surviving in ARAM. His Q &#8211; Obliterate is one of the hardest-hitting abilities in League of Legends when “beefed” up with the right build. And his R &#8211; Realm of Death grants Mordekaiser a free kill in 99% of the situations.</p>



<p>All of this combined makes a very easy and very dominating champion. Mordekaiser’s true strength lies in his ability to 1v1 any champion in the game. So if you want to succeed as Mordekaiser, start by eliminating enemy players one by one!</p>



<p>Now let’s jump onto the build!</p>



<h2><strong>Best Build for Mordekaiser in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h2><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>The Summoner’s Spells for Mordekaiser seldom change!&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>&nbsp;is mandatory for all champions, and&nbsp;<strong>Mark&nbsp;</strong>is the next best mobility spell in ARAM! You can sometimes swap it for&nbsp;<strong>Ignite</strong>, but since Mordekaiser doesn’t have any dashes or leaps, Mark will be necessary for gap-closing!</p>



<h2><strong>Best runes for ARAM Mordekaiser</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="574" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-1024x574.png" alt="Runes for Mordekaiser are basically the same ones that you would use on the Summoners Rift. Nothing's different. The main rune for him is Conqueror, alongside with Triumph, Last Stand, Taste of Blood, and Ravenous Hunter. " class="wp-image-10606" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-1024x574.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-300x168.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-768x430.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-1536x861.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-2048x1148.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-750x420.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-mordekaiser-1140x639.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Conqueror</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Conqueror&nbsp;</strong>is the go-to keystone for Mordekaiser in all game modes in League of Legends. This rune is simply amazing for melee champions for the raw healing and damage it provides during a fight. With every attack and ability against an enemy champion, you buff up with bonus adaptive damage and healing. Mordekaiser can very quickly stack this rune up, which makes a natural choice for him.</p>



<h3><strong>Triumph</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Triumph</strong>&nbsp;is a must for many champions in LoL, including Mordekaiser. Since Morde is 99% of the time in the front line, constantly fighting, he desperately needs passive healing. Triumph restores HP after every kill/assist and is a very useful rune on Mordekaiser.</p>



<h3><strong>Legend: Tenacity</strong></h3>



<p>And since Morde doesn’t have any form of mobility in his kit, crowd control abilities can certainly stop him from carrying the game. Well,&nbsp;<strong>Legend: Tenacity</strong>&nbsp;removes a significant portion of these effects by making him almost immune to them. So make sure to pick it up every game!</p>



<h3><strong>Last Stand</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Last Stand</strong>&nbsp;fits perfectly with the playstyle of Mordekaiser. The rune grants up to 11% bonus damage while you’re below 60% HP. Mordekaiser isn’t a squishy champion, but he is very susceptible to poking and being slowly drained. So having extra power while being on low HP is very useful for him!</p>



<h3><strong>Taste of Blood</strong></h3>



<p>The core idea of playing Mordekaiser is to be a nuisance to anyone in the enemy team by constantly being there up in their faces. But that won’t be possible without self-healing!&nbsp;<strong>Taste of Blood</strong>&nbsp;is a very reliable rune in this sense because every 20 seconds, Mordekaiser gets a “free” heal through one of his abilities!</p>



<h3><strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong></h3>



<p>And the same goes for&nbsp;<strong>Ravenous Hunter</strong>! This rune provides you with up to 2% omnivamp based on stacks you get by scoring kills or assists. It may not seem like much, but with enough champion takedowns, Mordekaiser can top his health only with his W!</p>



<h3><strong>Bonuses</strong></h3>



<p>For the bonus runes, the best combination for Mordekaiser in ARAM is one <strong>Attack Speed</strong> rune, one <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" data-type="post" data-id="9325"><strong>Adaptive Force </strong>rune</a>, and one <strong>Armor/Magic Resist </strong>rune.</p>

<h3><strong>Riftmaker</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Riftmaker&nbsp;</strong>is a fantastic mythic item that simply works wonders on Mordekaiser! It synergizes extremely well with Conqueror and thus makes Morde one of the scariest champions to face in 1v1. Riftmaker grants stacks of bonus damage for each second spent in combat. And at 10 stacks, Mordekaiser deals true damage!</p>



<h3><strong>Mercury’s Treads</strong></h3>



<p>Remember what we said about Legend: Tenacity and Mordekaiser? Well, the same goes here! The best counterplay to Mordekaiser is CC. But if he can freely walk Howling Fjord, he’ll be the strongest champion in the match! That’s why&nbsp;<strong>Mercury’s Treads</strong>&nbsp;are the must-have boots on Morde!</p>



<h3><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Demonic Embrace</strong>&nbsp;is another of those items that slowly charge their powers. This one, however, instead of granting bonus flat damage, burns your enemies based on their maximum HP. It is a very powerful item overall, especially against tanks. Plus, it grants you magic resist and armor while the burning effect is on!</p>



<h3><strong>Rylai’s Crystal Scepter</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Rylai’s Crystal Scepter</strong>&nbsp;has been one of the key items for Mordekaiser’s build ever since the champion was reworked. Due to his short ability range, Morde struggles to chase mobile champions down. So, Rylai’s Crystal Scepter simply helps him keep his enemies in range!</p>



<h3><strong>Zhonya’s Hourglass</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Zhonya’s Hourglass</strong>&nbsp;is a core item as well, simply because Morde has no option of escaping a fight when he is in danger. The active &#8211; Stasis, allows him to by himself some time and turn the duel the other way!</p>



<h3><strong>Spirit Visage</strong></h3>



<p>And as the last item, <strong>Spirit Visage </strong>has proven to be the best choice overall. Needless to say that in any ARAM match there is at least one AP champion in the enemy team, so Spirit Visage will always have at least some value. But the reason why it is a must for Mordekaiser is that it boosts the healing he does during the game. So, make sure to always purchase it!</p>

<h2><strong>Janna in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h2>



<p>If you want the very&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-off-meta-supports/" rel="noreferrer noopener">best support</a>&nbsp;in season 11 in ARAM, then pray to the League of Legends Gods to grant you, Janna! This champion is extremely strong in this game mode because she rises to power only after a few minutes in. Her mythic item is very cheap, and it boosts her potential to carry a hundredfold!</p>



<p>Janna’s power lies in her ability to set up kills but also to avoid getting harmed. Her Q &#8211; Howlin Gale has an excellent range, and it’s much easier to hit in ARAM since the terrain is narrower. Her W &#8211; Zephyr can surprise you with its damage, while her E &#8211; Eye of the Storm becomes a “half-HP” shield when you max it up. And her R &#8211; Monsoon tops everybody’s health, and it’s an invaluable tool for healing in ARAM!</p>



<p>However, the biggest downside to playing Janna is that she can be too&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy</a>. Enemy champions can fairly easy one-shot you or just melt you in one stun. You’ll have to be very careful about how you position, where you click, and which fights you engage in. But if you play on the defensive foot and take all these things into consideration, then you can tilt your opponents in no time!</p>



<p>This is our complete guide on how to best build Janna in season 11 in ARAM, which runes to pick up, as well as what to consider when choosing your Summoner Spells. So let’s begin!</p>

<h2><strong>Best Build for Janna in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h3>



<p>The best Summoner’s Spells for Janna in ARAM are&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>. As Janna, you can frequently end up having mana issues, so Clarity helps a ton with that, especially in the early 5 to 10 minutes. Plus, it helps your team as well.</p>



<p>You can also switch up to&nbsp;<strong>Heal</strong>&nbsp;if your teammates bring&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>&nbsp;of their own.&nbsp;<strong>Mark</strong>&nbsp;can also be a good option if you want to be the playmaker and do inSec kicks with Janna’s ultimate.</p>



<h2><strong>Best runes for Janna in ARAM</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="571" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-1024x571.png" alt="Janna is one of the most underrated champions in League of Legends, and to be honest, we like it that way because nobody understands how truly powerful she is! Once you learn how to use her Q effectively, she's one of the best supports in the game. Here are the best runes for Janna in ARAM!" class="wp-image-10594" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-1024x571.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-300x167.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-768x428.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-1536x857.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-2048x1142.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-750x418.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-janna-1140x636.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Arcane Comet</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Arcane Comet</strong>&nbsp;has been the default keystone option for Janna for a long time. This is the case in season 11 as well, primarily because Janna can spam its effect very easily thanks to her W. The applied slow helps her land the comet, and since Janna has only two damaging abilities, Arcane Comet is an excellent DPS boost for a support champion.</p>



<h3><strong>Manaflow Band</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Manaflow Band&nbsp;</strong>is here to fix Janna’s mana problem. The way this rune works is pretty simple, actually. Once in 15 seconds, you have the chance to both return your missing mana and to increase your maximum mana. And you only have to damage an enemy champion with either Q or W for it!</p>



<h3><strong>Transcendence</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Transcendence</strong>&nbsp;will add a bunch of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/difference-between-ability-haste-and-cooldown-reduction/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ability haste</a>&nbsp;to your kit and help you spam those tornados for the rest of the game. Combined with your item build, you’re looking at a very active Janna from start to end!</p>



<h3><strong>Gathering Storm</strong></h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Gathering Storm</strong>&nbsp;is the preferred rune for Janna in the last row of the Sorcery tree. Every 10 minutes, it gives you a bonus flat AP, which is an excellent way to build your damaging without spending gold for it.</p>



<h3><strong>Relentless Hunter</strong></h3>



<p>For secondary runes, you should go for Domination, and&nbsp;<strong>Relentless Hunter&nbsp;</strong>especially. Now, Janna is naturally a very speedy champion. But with a stacked-up Relentless Hunter, she practically flies over the map. Yes, the bonus cancels as soon as you enter combat, but it’s very useful when trying to reach your teammates when they need help.</p>



<h3><strong>Eyeball Collection</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Eyeball Collection</strong>&nbsp;is the only other rune choice that significantly helps Janna. It passively builds her AP without any effort. So you only have to pick up before the game starts and forget about it.</p>



<h2><strong>Bonuses</strong></h2>



<p>The choice for bonuses is the easiest of all. Two&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Adaptive Forces</strong></a>&nbsp;and one&nbsp;<strong>Armor / Magic Penetration</strong>&nbsp;is the way to go in all ARAM games.</p>

<h3><strong>Imperial Mandate</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Imperial Mandate</strong>&nbsp;is the mythic item we mentioned at the start. It gives Janna all of her most important stats &#8211; ability power, ability haste, health, and mana regeneration. And it only costs 2500 gold, so you can purchase it on your first back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imperial Mandate will deal bonus magic damage to enemies when you use either Q or W against them. Plus, it increases the value of any AP item you buy next.</p>



<h3><strong>Ionian Boots of Lucidity</strong></h3>



<p>As for boots, Janna goes best with&nbsp;<strong>Ionian Boots of Lucidity</strong>. Her best stat is ability haste, and anything that increases it is more than welcome.</p>



<h3><strong>Ardent Censer</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Ardent Censer&nbsp;</strong>is part of Janna’s core item build in ARAM, as well as ranked and&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-urf-runes/" rel="noreferrer noopener">URF</a>. It transforms her E and R into game-breaking boosts that benefit all your teammates, especially the marksmen champions.</p>



<h3><strong>Staff of Flowing Waters</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Staff of Flowing Waters</strong>&nbsp;provides a nice movement speed buff for Janna and her teammates every time she uses a shield or a heal. And it can be excellent for both running away and chasing down enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Redemption</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Redemption&nbsp;</strong>is a great way to double your healing potential as Janna. It’s another very cheap item that you can always purchase, which will help you keep your friends alive. Plus, you can use it while you’re dead!</p>



<h3><strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong></h3>



<p>And as for the last item, we highly suggest you go for <strong>Rabadon’s Deathcap</strong>. By the time you reach it, you’ll already have great utility with the rest of your build. Rabadon’s Deathcap will not only enhance your damage but your shields as well. Getting it can make you powerful enough to close the game on your own!</p>

<h2><strong>Soraka in ARAM in Season 11 &#8211; Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h2>



<p>Soraka is one of the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-off-meta-supports/" rel="noreferrer noopener">best support champions</a>&nbsp;in ARAM in season 11, simply because her build is just too good at carrying games. You see, Soraka’s greatest strength isn’t in her damage potential nor her defensive stats. Instead, she can top her allies’ health bars from the beginning to the end of the game. This allows Soraka’s team to always be at an advantage, which results in her winning more games than the average player. So if you get Soraka in your champion select in ARAM in season 11, make sure to prepare the best build for her!</p>



<p>And the build that we’re going to elaborate on here focuses on Soraka’s true power &#8211; healing and sustain. Regardless if you’re going to play this champion aggressively or passively, we will teach you how to excel at playing Soraka. This guide will show you which items to purchase in which order, as well as which runes to pick up before even the match starts.</p>



<p>Before we jump into the actual build, though, please be aware of Soraka’s strongest and weakest points. As Soraka, you should never be able to 1v1 another champion &#8211; a fact! Yes, Soraka can do some great damage with a few AP items, but she is much better at staying behind and supporting her teammates while they do the hard work! Another thing is that Soraka is a very&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-survive-using-squishy-champions-on-lol/" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy champion</a>&nbsp;and usually gets a one-shot by the likes of Zed, Fizz, or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-zoe-aram-build/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoe</a>. So, you’ll be wise to stay behind and heal your allies!</p>



<p>With that said, let’s break down how to best build Soraka in ARAM in Season 11!</p>



<h2><strong>Best Build for Soraka in ARAM in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h2><strong>Summoner’s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>Summoner’s Spells are the first thing to decide in champion select. In ARAM, Soraka mainly favors three options:&nbsp;<strong>Flash</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Heal</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Clarity</strong>. And the choice between them is simple! While Flash stays as a default option, you switch between Heal and Clarity according to the situation at hand. If one or more people on your time have already picked up Clarity, then you select Heal. And vice versa!</p>



<h2><strong>Best runes for Soraka in ARAM</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="571" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-1024x571.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10572" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-1024x571.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-300x167.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-768x428.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-1536x857.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-2048x1142.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-750x418.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-runes-for-aram-soraka-1140x636.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3><strong>Summon Aery</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Summon Aery&nbsp;</strong>is the best offensive and defensive keystone for Soraka in any&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-featured-game-modes-in-league-of-legends/" rel="noreferrer noopener">League of Legends game mode</a>. It is a very flexible rune that provides useful utility all around. It does good damage when you hit a spell, and grants a nice shield when you heal an ally. Pretty helpful in both scenarios.</p>



<h3><strong>Manaflow Band</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Manaflow Band</strong>&nbsp;can be very OP if you know how to utilize it. The rune itself gives you a maximum of 25 mana when you hit an enemy champion, up to 250 mana. Then it no longer increases your mana, but instead gives you mana regeneration. It has a 15 seconds cooldown, which is great for a fast-paced game of ARAM. And if you didn’t know, you can track this cooldown on top of your HUD. So make sure to time your Qs every time Manaflow Band is available just so you get the most use out of it!</p>



<h3><strong>Transcendence&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Transcendence&nbsp;</strong>perfectly fits Soraka’s playstyle. It grants bonus ability haste as you level up, as well as cooldown reduction when you score a kill or an assist. And because Soraka’s success depends on her abilities, having them always ready is very crucial!</p>



<h3><strong>Scorch</strong></h3>



<p>In the last row of the Sorcery tree,&nbsp;<strong>Scorch</strong>&nbsp;is the best rune to consider. It helps tremendously with the damage in the early game, especially on Soraka. Plus, it has only 10 seconds cooldown, so you have a reason not to take it!</p>



<h3><strong>Revitalize</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>Revitalize&nbsp;</strong>is a very important rune that you should always pick up on Soraka. It boosts her heals and shields on targets below 40% HP. And because people are constantly fighting in ARAM, you’ll always have an ally below 40% HP that requires healing.</p>



<h3><strong>Bone Plating</strong></h3>



<p>And&nbsp;<strong>Bone Plating</strong>&nbsp;is an extremely good defensive choice for Soraka. It nullifies a potential one-shot from the enemy every 45 seconds, which can really ruin the experience of playing Soraka for you.</p>



<h3><strong>Bonuses</strong></h3>



<p>You want to take two&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-adaptive-force-in-league-of-legends-and-what-does-it-do/" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Adaptive Forces</strong></a><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;plus an&nbsp;<strong>Armor/Magic Resist&nbsp;</strong>rune out of the bonuses as Soraka in ARAM.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="571" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-1024x571.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10571" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-1024x571.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-300x167.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-768x428.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-1536x857.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-2048x1143.png 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-750x418.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-items-for-aram-soraka-1140x636.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<h3><strong>Moonstone Renewer</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Moonstone Renewer&nbsp;</strong>is without a doubt the best mythic item for Soraka in League of Legends. It works like this: when you enter combat, you heal your allies significantly more! And the longer you spend in combat, the more this effect stacks. In prolonged ARAM fights, this can be a real game-changer!</p>



<h3><strong>Ardent Censer</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Ardent Censer</strong>&nbsp;is the standard second item choice for Soraka. It grants bonus attack speed and magic damage to a healed ally, making them stronger. This item works well on all champions, and it’s a must in Soraka’s build.</p>



<h3><strong>Ionian Boots of Lucidity</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Ionian Boots of Lucidity&nbsp;</strong>are the best boots upgrades for Soraka. As we mentioned earlier, Soraka’s power relies on her always being ready to help out in a team fight, so the bonus ability haste from these boots is very valuable.</p>



<h3><strong>Redemption</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Redemption</strong>&nbsp;is another core item that you must always get on Soraka. It increases your HP and healing potential, as well as your&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/difference-between-ability-haste-and-cooldown-reduction/" rel="noreferrer noopener">ability haste</a>&nbsp;and mana regeneration. Plus, the active can turn the tide of a fight, and it’s usable while being dead!</p>



<h3><strong>Staff of Flowing Water</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Staff of Flowing Water</strong>&nbsp;is an extremely valuable item for Soraka. Whenever you heal a teammate, Staff of Flowing Water will grant you a movement speed bonus, which matches Soraka’s playstyle of constantly tending to wounded allies.</p>



<h3><strong>Warmog’s Armor</strong></h3>



<p>Near the end of the game, <strong>Warmog’s Armor</strong> will be the strongest purchase for this champion. Soraka’s heals take a portion of her HP, so having more HP means more healing! Additionally, the bonus health helps her stay around longer and assure the team’s victory!</p>
