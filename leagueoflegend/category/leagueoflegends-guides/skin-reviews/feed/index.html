<p>Nidalee, the Bestial Huntress, has two sides to her, her human and her cougar form. This special ability allows room for many different styles of skins. Most of the skins are satisfying &#8211; and in this review, you’ll find out which.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Snow Bunny Nidalee</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snow-Bunny-Nidalee-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13452" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snow-Bunny-Nidalee-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snow-Bunny-Nidalee-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snow-Bunny-Nidalee-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snow-Bunny-Nidalee-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snow-Bunny-Nidalee-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snow-Bunny-Nidalee-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snow-Bunny-Nidalee-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snow-Bunny-Nidalee-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Snow Bunny Nidalee is a basic skin with a re-texture. The human version of her has pale skin with white hair. Her clothes help the theme, and the result is fine but nothing extraordinary. Her cougar version seems to try to go for a snow leopard look but doesn&#8217;t succeed at it. In the end, it&#8217;s a nice-looking skin for a low price.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>2. Leopard Nidalee</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="614" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/leopard-nidalee-skin-1024x614.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13450" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/leopard-nidalee-skin-1024x614.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/leopard-nidalee-skin-300x180.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/leopard-nidalee-skin-768x461.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/leopard-nidalee-skin-1536x922.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/leopard-nidalee-skin-150x90.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/leopard-nidalee-skin-750x450.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/leopard-nidalee-skin-1140x684.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/leopard-nidalee-skin.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Leopard Nidalee is about what you&#8217;d expect; Nidalee as a leopard with leopard colors. The human form has her hair light with clothes made from leopard fur. The new look offers elegance that suits her personality. The cougar side of her gets a spotted fur look with bands on her legs and her tail. Her normal mane is gone, and in replacement are some big tusks. The leopard look is done well, and the skin is nice for Nidalee’s fans.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New models</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>3. French Maid Nidalee</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="600" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/french-maid-nidalee-skin-1024x600.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13448" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/french-maid-nidalee-skin-1024x600.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/french-maid-nidalee-skin-300x176.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/french-maid-nidalee-skin-768x450.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/french-maid-nidalee-skin-1536x900.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/french-maid-nidalee-skin-150x88.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/french-maid-nidalee-skin-750x440.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/french-maid-nidalee-skin-1140x668.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/french-maid-nidalee-skin.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>French Maid Nidalee is a good skin considering its price as well. The human form has her in a maid uniform, which is a nice look. The Cougar side of her closely resembles a domestic cat with black fur. The concept is nicely represented. French Maid Nidalee is perfect for fans of the look.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Changes</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>4. Pharaoh Nidalee&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pharaoh-nidalee-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13451" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pharaoh-nidalee-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pharaoh-nidalee-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pharaoh-nidalee-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pharaoh-nidalee-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pharaoh-nidalee-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pharaoh-nidalee-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/pharaoh-nidalee-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Pharaoh Nidalee gives her a new Egyptian look. The human form isn&#8217;t as historically accurate, but that&#8217;s okay. The theme is a nice change from what we normally see. Her spear matches the entire design of the skin. Her cougar side is now a Siamese cat that adorns golden decorations. The cat does match the entire theme. It obviously is lacking in some areas and could hardly be called perfect. However, the skin is cheap and nice for her fans.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Changes</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>5. Bewitching Nidalee</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bewitching-nidalee-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13446" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bewitching-nidalee-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bewitching-nidalee-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bewitching-nidalee-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bewitching-nidalee-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bewitching-nidalee-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bewitching-nidalee-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bewitching-nidalee-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bewitching-nidalee-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Bewitching Nidalee is a great Halloween skin that&#8217;ll have you ready for that spooky time of the year. Her human side presents her as a witch wearing somewhat modern styled clothes. Her hat and broom are what clearly represent the theme. She wears a dress that seems like a corset and high-heeled boots. The cougar side is a black cat, of course. She wears a hat with bands that help the witch aspect. Bewitching Nidalee is a nice interpretation of the witch idea. The skin is perfect for you Halloween lovers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Major Model Changes</li><li>New particles</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>6.&nbsp; Headhunter Nidalee</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Headhunter-Nidalee-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13449" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Headhunter-Nidalee-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Headhunter-Nidalee-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Headhunter-Nidalee-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Headhunter-Nidalee-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Headhunter-Nidalee-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Headhunter-Nidalee-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Headhunter-Nidalee-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Headhunter-Nidalee-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Headhunter Nidalee gives a more futuristic look with alien predator feels. Her human form has revealing armor that doesn&#8217;t seem very practical for battle. The result of the armor is appealing, even if it does clash with the deadly theme. The predator concept is good for Nidalee. Her cougar form gets a look like an alien predator with a slender and strong body. The alien aspect is appealing, and overall, the skin is a nice skin for you sci-fil lovers.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>If you hate sci-fi, this isn’t the skin for you.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>7. Warring Kingdoms Nidalee</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="559" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Warring-Kingdoms-Nidalee-skin-1024x559.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13454" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Warring-Kingdoms-Nidalee-skin-1024x559.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Warring-Kingdoms-Nidalee-skin-300x164.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Warring-Kingdoms-Nidalee-skin-768x419.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Warring-Kingdoms-Nidalee-skin-1536x838.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Warring-Kingdoms-Nidalee-skin-150x82.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Warring-Kingdoms-Nidalee-skin-750x409.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Warring-Kingdoms-Nidalee-skin-1140x622.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Warring-Kingdoms-Nidalee-skin.jpg 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Warring Kingdoms Nidalee gives her a royal feel and has appeal, but it&#8217;s anything but perfect. Her human alter-ego appears elegant and simple. The dress is appealing and highly decorated. On her other side, the cougar is now a white panther decorated with gold. The decorations help the cougar get an interesting look. She even has flower particles to make it interesting. The result is elegance in both of her forms. Warring Kingdoms Nidalee has its positives and negatives, but that doesn&#8217;t make it a bad skin.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>There aren&#8217;t any cons to this skin.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>8. Challenger Nidalee</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Challenger-Nidalee-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13447" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Challenger-Nidalee-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Challenger-Nidalee-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Challenger-Nidalee-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Challenger-Nidalee-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Challenger-Nidalee-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Challenger-Nidalee-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Challenger-Nidalee-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Challenger-Nidalee-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Challenger Nidalee presents her with a more fantasy look. Her human form is colorful and vivid. She keeps is practical with a spear that has a nice design, and she wears a tiara. Her hair is eye-catching next to her clothes. The look is anything but not impressive. Her feline side gets armor as well and even a tiara. The cougar also sticks with the skin theme. This skin gets some nice particles as well that are re-colored with the same colors as her armor. Sounds are missing anything significant and fail to add to the theme. Challenger Nidalee is a great skin with a nice interpretation, so it is recommended.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Another skin that lacks a con</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>9. Super Galaxy Nidalee&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Super-Galaxy-Nidalee-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13453" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Super-Galaxy-Nidalee-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Super-Galaxy-Nidalee-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Super-Galaxy-Nidalee-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Super-Galaxy-Nidalee-skin-1536x906.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Super-Galaxy-Nidalee-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Super-Galaxy-Nidalee-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Super-Galaxy-Nidalee-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Super-Galaxy-Nidalee-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Lastly, we have Super Galaxy Nidalee, which transforms her into a robot. The new hi-tech look offers plenty of features to make it an excellent skin. Human Nidalee wears a suit that is perfect for a robotic look. It stays casual but offers a futuristic look. The style is nicely done for her. Cougar Nidalee is colorful and full of decorations. There&#8217;s no doubt that it represents a robot. In addition to the model, the particles get a futuristic feel. Sounds are different in the two forms, human gets high pitched metallic sounds, and the cougar form is almost mechanical. The two forms get two recalls, the human form is a display of power, and the cougar form shows her feline nature. In the end, Super Galaxy Nidalee is a colorful and fun skin that is flashy and appealing, perfect for Nidalee players.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>You get so many features for the low price; what is there to hate?</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Nidalee is a fun character with her two alter-egos, so this makes skins exciting with many changes. Headhunter Nidalee is the recommended choice as the alien theme is clearly executed and offers a suiting skin for her personality. Another skin to not ignore is Warring Kingdoms Nidalee. The skin is elegant, and the flower particles give her a royal feel. While the skin isn&#8217;t perfect, it still is appealing, and besides, no skin is absolutely perfect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Challenger Nidalee has some exciting visuals but gets boring pretty quickly. The skin has a nice theme and is appealing in both of her forms. Super Galaxy Nidalee has a more colorful feel for the huntress. The skin is flashy but maintains a stylish look. Overall, the skin shouldn’t be overlooked.</p>



<p>Pharaoh Nidalee struggles to be realistic but still has a pleasing look, especially with the Siamese cat. It&#8217;s a nice choice for the low price. Lastly, we have French Maid Nidalee with an attractive look for her human side and her feline. The price makes sense for the lack of features and originality.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>1. Mafia Jinx</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="640" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mafia-jinx-skin-1024x640.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13318" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mafia-jinx-skin-1024x640.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mafia-jinx-skin-300x188.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mafia-jinx-skin-768x480.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mafia-jinx-skin-150x94.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mafia-jinx-skin-750x469.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mafia-jinx-skin-1140x713.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mafia-jinx-skin.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Mafia Jinx goes for the Roaring Twenties era. With a flapper-style allowing a fresh and playful look. Unfortunately, the model looks a little inadequate when it comes to textures. She rocks a pearl necklace and simple fingerless gloves that are expected to be something a more elaborate. The concept is well adapted. This skin also offers a new dance and a whimsical recall. For the price, you can’t overlook this skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New models</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>If you hate the 1920 style, move along</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>2. Firecracker Jinx</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-jinx-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13317" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-jinx-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-jinx-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-jinx-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-jinx-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-jinx-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-jinx-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-jinx-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-jinx-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Firecracker Jinx is the perfect theme for Jinx, keeping her personality of mayhem. The best feature of this skin is the firework sounds and particles, as they are rather eye-catching. Her weapons, Fishbones and Pow-Pow, now adorn dragon designs. However, while this skin is attractive, there are really no features that explain the high price. If you love fireworks and Jinx, this skin is for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>There isn’t much to hate about this skin</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>3. Slayer Jinx</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="1000" height="590" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/slayer-jinx-skin.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13319" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/slayer-jinx-skin.jpg 1000w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/slayer-jinx-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/slayer-jinx-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/slayer-jinx-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/slayer-jinx-skin-750x443.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>



<p>Slayer Jinx is a skin that disappoints. The skin is almost indistinguishable from her classic style. The weapons opt for an alternative look than normal, though. It still fails to look any different for a zombie huntress. Slayer Jinx doesn’t have a horrible result, but more could have been done for it. If you love the classic look with a little bit of edge, Slayer Jinx is especially for you.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The price</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>4. Star Guardian Jinx</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-jinx-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13320" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-jinx-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-jinx-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-jinx-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-jinx-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-jinx-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-jinx-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-jinx.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Star Guardian Jinx successfully adapts Jinx’s normal rebellious personality into a more youthful and passionate skin. It sticks with the expected style of Jinx. This skin has an exciting feature, and her weapons turn into Familiars, Shiro represents her minigun, and Kuro represents her rocket launcher. With obvious representations to shoulder angels and devils, it perfects Jinx’s mischievous personality. The adaption accomplishes in all areas, the particles and sounds are significant, and the animations are noteworthy. This skin will have you testing your will to not buy it.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The cuteness overload will have everyone jealous</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1820 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>5. Ambitious Elf Jinx</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="587" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ambitious-Elf-Jinx-skin-1024x587.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13315" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ambitious-Elf-Jinx-skin-1024x587.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ambitious-Elf-Jinx-skin-300x172.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ambitious-Elf-Jinx-skin-768x440.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ambitious-Elf-Jinx-skin-1536x880.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ambitious-Elf-Jinx-skin-150x86.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ambitious-Elf-Jinx-skin-750x430.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ambitious-Elf-Jinx-skin-1140x653.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Ambitious-Elf-Jinx-skin.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Ambitious Elf Jinx is a Christmas themed skin that does well at keeping her mischief characteristic. She wears a red dress, striped stockings, and a pointy hat keeping the elf theme, but this theme doesn’t travel down to her boots, as they are simple. This skin has a playful and humorous approach that suits her well. Her weapons get new looks; Pow-Pow becomes a toy train while Fishbones becomes a long cardboard box. It does fail to fulfill the toy angle and would have been perfect had it been more emphasized. Ambitious Elf Jinx has its flaws, but there’s doubt that it’s intriguing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>If you hate Christmas, then this skin isn’t for you.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>6. Odyssey Jinx&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Odyssey-Jinx-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13321" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Odyssey-Jinx-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Odyssey-Jinx-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Odyssey-Jinx-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Odyssey-Jinx-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Odyssey-Jinx-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Odyssey-Jinx-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Odyssey-Jinx-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Odyssey-Jinx-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Odyssey Jinx styles Jinx as a cyborg pilot. She gets casual yet stylish clothes with a flattering hairstyle and cyborg arm. This version of Jinx doesn’t stray from her classic identity. The cyborg arm has no function; it’s just there for looks. Odyssey Jinx is more of a good change of clothes rather than good functions. It clearly lacks depth, but the personality of Jinx is intact. It delivers the theme but fails to go above and beyond. It’s a good skin, but it should have been bolder.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The absence of a con</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>With a character like Jinx, skins can be creative and different. The highly recommended skin is Mafia Jinx; it was a released skin that fulfilled moving her style to another era. It’s a great skin for fans of the 1920s.</p>



<p>The other alternative to Mafia Jinx is Firecracker Jinx. Firecracker Jinx is a fantastic skin with astonishing visuals and sounds. Unfortunately, some areas aren’t as convincing. While it’s an attractive and appealing skin, it doesn’t justify the high price. I would suggest catching it when it’s on sale.</p>



<p>Slayer Jinx sticks with the classic look and doesn’t stray far from it at all. The aesthetic of her weapons is astounding, but there’s nothing that completes the zombie theme aside from the recall. It lacks outstanding features and has a high price, but still nice for Jinx’s fans.</p>



<p>Star Guardian Jinx is a skin worthy of its legendary title. The particles, sounds, animations, and the model are all fantastic. The familiars are what makes the skin absolutely astonishing, it gives a new feel to Jinx and gives the skin a unique personality. This is a skin that all Jinx fans will cherish.</p>



<p>Ambitious Elf Jinx is a delightful skin that suits her personality and gives a playful display of her mischievous behavior. The addition of the snow and ice fails to assist the skin’s theme. It’s a skin that feels almost incomplete, but still attractive if you ignore the conflicting varying parts of the skin. Ambitious Elf Jinx will have you feeling jolly and bursting with joy for Christmas, unless you dislike Christmas, and with that, I say, bah humbug.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Odyssey Jinx is a nice skin but also a bit dull. The skin fails to represent her identity and make any modifications to it. The interpretation successfully makes it known that it’s a space theme skin. The result of Odyssey Jinx is appealing, yet there’s much to be credited to the Classis Jinx. Still a great skin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For those of you who have Shen, Eye of Twilight, as your main, you&#8217;re in luck because he has various skins that you can choose from. This is the type of champion that can sport around a colorful ninja suit and get away with it. You can&#8217;t see this guy through the shadows, so what he&#8217;s wearing doesn&#8217;t matter, but when you walk out on the battleground, it&#8217;s always nice to do it in style. So, here&#8217;s a list of the best Shen skins, I&#8217;ve listed them from worst to best, so the further you get down on this list, the better the costumes will be.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Frozen Shen</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/best-shen-skins-frozen-shen-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11465" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/best-shen-skins-frozen-shen-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/best-shen-skins-frozen-shen-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/best-shen-skins-frozen-shen-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/best-shen-skins-frozen-shen-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/best-shen-skins-frozen-shen-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/best-shen-skins-frozen-shen.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The concept here features our Shen dressed up in blue tones with frosted arms. An interesting idea, if I must say. Looking at the Frozen Shen skin, it&#8217;s evident that there is some sort of reference to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Zero_(Mortal_Kombat)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sub-Zero</a>&nbsp;going on, and I like it in a way. There are blue tones that go from dark to light, yet they always seem to remain in the middle. This, I believe, hides the subtler details and prevents the new design from really shining. Regardless, the plus side to this skin is that it is different from the classic style. I believe it would have been good if Riot would have added additional frosty details to his arms. The Frozen Shen skin is a good change and is appealing. I just feel that it could use a little extra, but that&#8217;s just me.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>It doesn&#8217;t look like the classic design</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li></ul>



<p><strong>The cost of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>2. Yellow Jacket Shen</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yellow-jacket-shen-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11471" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yellow-jacket-shen-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yellow-jacket-shen-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yellow-jacket-shen-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yellow-jacket-shen-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yellow-jacket-shen-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yellow-jacket-shen-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>As the name suggests, this feature Shen dressed in yellow and black, which isn&#8217;t that bad of an idea because these colors actually fit him. The yellow and black colors make an excellent contrast of colors. Yellow Jacket Shen adapts&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Scorpion" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scorpion&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;look to the Eye of Twilight and provides a more traditional yet still dazzling ninja look. Although the yellow and black palette is the most distinct characteristic, thanks to the lovely contrast of colors it provides, there&#8217;s more to it than that. The aggressive design of armor has been reinforced by torn cloth, making the Yellow Jacket Shen skin stand out from the crowd. The downside here is that the darker parts of the skin hide much of their details. Regardless, Yellow Jacket Shen is a nice look for Shen, and while it feels familiar, at the same time, it&#8217;s a tad bit different from his normal look. For those of you who are fans of ninjas, chances are you&#8217;ll like this skin. It&#8217;s a cheap yet attractive look for Shen.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model for Shens</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li></ul>



<p><strong>The cost of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>3. Surgeon Shen</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/surgeon-shen-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11468" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/surgeon-shen-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/surgeon-shen-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/surgeon-shen-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/surgeon-shen-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/surgeon-shen-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/surgeon-shen-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Surgeon Shen is decent skin that features Shen dressed up as a surgeon wielding scalpels that are oversized. Obviously, this skin was meant to be a joke, but the problem is, it&#8217;s funny at first, but after you&#8217;ve seen it so many times, it just stops being funny. Plus, you know a surgeon&#8217;s outfit doesn&#8217;t exactly belong on the battlefield, and I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s so funny about it. The skin does a great job at imitating a surgeon. The trousers have pockets, and he has a buttoned shirt with folded sleeves, and don&#8217;t forget about those long rubber gloves. Oh yeah, and the cap and mask combined with a pair of crocs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open crocs aren&#8217;t the best thing to have in the surgery room because falling instruments can hurt. The stethoscope doesn&#8217;t make that much sense, and the apron with the loincloth doesn&#8217;t belong. The huge scalpels that are used as weapons take away any remaining seriousness of this skin that there may have been. What we have here is a comical ninja-surgeon, and it&#8217;s not exactly faithful to reality. Unless you happen to be a fan of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://mcninja.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._McNinja" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. McNinja</a>&nbsp;or you would like Shen to wear some glasses, you&#8217;re not going to find this skin appealing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Shen dressed up as a surgeon can be funny.</li><li>New model for Shen, his Spirit Blade, and his ninjatos</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The humor dies off quickly</li></ul>



<p><strong>The cost of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>4. Blood Moon Shen</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blood-moon-shen-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11467" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blood-moon-shen-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blood-moon-shen-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blood-moon-shen-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blood-moon-shen-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blood-moon-shen-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blood-moon-shen-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This skin features Shen playing the role of a dark spirit in the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Ionia" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ionian Festival of Fire Play</a>&nbsp;– it is a resemblance of a Japanese Noh theatre play. This skin features a new model for Shen – his ninjatos and Spirit blade. While his lower body has remnants of Shen&#8217;s classic look, the rest of him looks fantastic. The look pays tribute to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://capcom.fandom.com/wiki/Bishamon#:~:text=Bishamon%20is%20a%20character%20in,the%20Japanese%20God%20of%20War." rel="noreferrer noopener">Bishamon from Darkstalkers</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Putting armor to the side, his suit has some good detail, but unfortunately, it&#8217;s hard to notice some of the detail because of the similarly dark hues and subtle elements being used. Regardless, his menacing look is complemented by spiked spaulders and bladed vambraces, which is a nice look for him. All in all, Blood Moon Shen is a fair skin if you&#8217;re going for a demonic look – it&#8217;s dark and appealing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Appealing look for Shen</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The bottom part of this skin has a classic look, as not much has been done.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The cost of this skin is 750 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>5. Warlord Shen</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="640" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/warlord-shen-skin-1024x640.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11470" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/warlord-shen-skin-1024x640.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/warlord-shen-skin-300x188.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/warlord-shen-skin-768x480.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/warlord-shen-skin-750x469.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/warlord-shen-skin-1140x713.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/warlord-shen-skin.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Warlord Shen doesn&#8217;t give off the traditional armored samurai vibes. Instead, he looks more like a fictional interpretation based on numerous sources. Starting out, his armor looks like it&#8217;s a mixture of tatami and kisari armor, resembling a yellow coat. The colors are pretty bright, to say the least. Samurai armors weren&#8217;t all dark and mute, but this can seem flamboyant. While the Shashimono looks believable, unfortunately, the back of the armor as well as the legs have a simple appearance and aren&#8217;t protected, like the inside of Shen&#8217;s arms are. Despite it all, the new look, animations, and particles are appealing, which may be surprising.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New particles and animations</li><li>New look</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The cost of this skin is 975 RP</strong></p>

<h2><strong>6. Pulsefire Shen</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="589" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/the-best-shen-skin-pulsefire-shen.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-11469" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/the-best-shen-skin-pulsefire-shen.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/the-best-shen-skin-pulsefire-shen-300x173.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/the-best-shen-skin-pulsefire-shen-768x442.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/the-best-shen-skin-pulsefire-shen-750x431.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Pulsefire Shen transforms Shen into a hi-tech ninja, which isn&#8217;t that bad of an idea. He has a new model, his Ninjatos and Spirit Blade. He also has new particles for his abilities, recall, auto-attack, and new sound for his recall and abilities. For the most part, he has a ninja suit on, which is rather modern, but it has some advanced-looking armor as well as some traditional. The swords show a similar mix, despite the holographic qualities – one is classic, and the other is advanced, but it looks kind of like a toy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the first skin that shows Shen&#8217;s hair, and that gives Shen a different look. The particles have holographic looks, like hi-tech, but there&#8217;s no variety in color, you only have some hues here and there. The grid pattern used for Shadow Dash and Ki Barrier may be subtle, but they&#8217;re nice. The trail of holographic copies that Shadow Dash leaves behind is also good – the petal appears in many abilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New animations</li><li>New particles</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Sounds – the sounds we a bit disappointing, there&#8217;s high-pitched energy variations, and those are only interesting when a brief echo has been added to them. The sounds lack impact. They may feel hi-tech, but they don&#8217;t feel strong or varied, even if they&#8217;re different.&nbsp;</li><li>Recall – The new recall is meaningless until the portal opens and Shen leaves. When he leaves on the ground, there&#8217;s more flashy nonsense going on.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>The cost of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Final Word</strong></h2>



<p>When it comes to outfits, Shen is an eclectic ninja. However, some are more attractive than the others. Blood Moon Shen is one I would recommend if you&#8217;re looking for a distinct appearance that fits the style of a ninja while being different. The demonic armor is pretty cool, while the ninja suit is attractive and distinct.</p>



<p>Pulesefire Shen has this champion as a hi-tech ninja with a liking for the traditional. The futuristic aspect is appealing, but there are areas that are lacking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frozen and Yellow Jacket Shen skins are pretty straightforward, and it&#8217;s obvious that they pay tribute to Mortal Kombat. Yellow Jacket has a more distinct appearance, but Frozen does stand out. For those of you who are fans of ninja, this duo of skins is worth considering. Then you have Surgeon Shen, the joke on the battlefield. It is funny at first, but once you&#8217;ve seen it half a billion times, it&#8217;s no longer funny. In fact, it can quickly become boring.</p>

<p>Janna, the Storms fury doesn’t opt for the modest wardrobe, but that doesn’t mean that she has limited attire selections. She still manages to be fashionable and elegant. To figure out how, read further on this skin review.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Tempest Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tempest-janna-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13271" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tempest-janna-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tempest-janna-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tempest-janna-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tempest-janna-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tempest-janna-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tempest-janna-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tempest-janna-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Tempest Janna goes for a more alternate look rather than her classic style. With new textures and minor model changes, as well as a new staff that helps distinguish Tempest Janna from Classic Janna. This skin shows that you can change the skin completely while still managing to maintain her classic style. For an inexpensive price and a new look, look no further.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Minor Model Changes</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>2. Hextech Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="605" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hextech-janna-skin-1024x605.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13268" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hextech-janna-skin-1024x605.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hextech-janna-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hextech-janna-skin-768x454.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hextech-janna-skin-1536x907.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hextech-janna-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hextech-janna-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hextech-janna-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hextech-janna-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Hextech Janna decided to go with a modest look, by covering her up with googles, to boots, allowing for a steampunk look. The hair is consistent with the Classic Janna but receives a new color. Hextech Janna is a skin that manages to stand out with an appealing look.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Major Model Changes</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>3. Frost Queen Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="640" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/frost-queen-janna-skin-1024x640.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13267" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/frost-queen-janna-skin-1024x640.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/frost-queen-janna-skin-300x188.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/frost-queen-janna-skin-768x480.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/frost-queen-janna-skin-1536x960.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/frost-queen-janna-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/frost-queen-janna-skin-150x94.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/frost-queen-janna-skin-750x469.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/frost-queen-janna-skin-1140x713.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Frost Queen Janna is a skin that executed the ice theme perfectly. It deviates from her Classic style but not too far as it still feels like a Janna skin. The new hairstyle looks rather similar to the classic one, however, it still looks great. While the skin has its flaws and areas to improve, there’s no doubt that it’s an awesome skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>New Model</li><li>New particles</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>4. Victorious Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/victorious-janna-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13272" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/victorious-janna-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/victorious-janna-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/victorious-janna-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/victorious-janna-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/victorious-janna-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/victorious-janna-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/victorious-janna-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/victorious-janna-skin.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Victorious Janna goes for a more classic warrior mage look. The result is believable for it and the look is sensible. The armor plates also seem practical but sturdy. Her hair opts for a shorter look and is even in a ponytail. It’s a great skin that lacks and isn’t worth much of a struggle to achieve.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is: Promotional it was awarded to Gold, Platinum and Diamond ranked players after Season 2</strong></p>

<h2><strong>5. Forecast Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/forecast-janna-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13266" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/forecast-janna-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/forecast-janna-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/forecast-janna-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/forecast-janna-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/forecast-janna-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/forecast-janna-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/forecast-janna-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Forecast Janna has a comical feel to her and it does everything it can to live up to that. In addition to a comedic feel, she has an appealing and friendly vibe. This Janna has a more journalistic personality, with a lasting appeal to her. It may need more work, but it’s still a great skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>This skin managed to over and beyond, so we don’t have any cons.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1820 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>6. Fnatic Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fnatic-janna-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13265" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fnatic-janna-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fnatic-janna-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fnatic-janna-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fnatic-janna-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fnatic-janna-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fnatic-janna-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fnatic-janna-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fnatic-janna-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Fnatic Janna may be nicely dressed and has a charm to it, it doesn’t stand out. It fails to attract attention and has a more casual look than previous skins. The only thing that is eye-catching is Fnatic’s logo, other than that it’s a good skin with an average style but nothing out of this world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 750 RP.</strong></p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-janna-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13270" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-janna-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-janna-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-janna-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-janna-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-janna-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-janna-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-janna-skin.jpg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Star Guardian has an interesting look but fails to fulfill the theme’s concept. The model isn’t anything out of the ordinary, however, the staff has a convincing design with feathers on the neck. The strips of cloth and the glow of the staff further expressing the theme of a magical girl role. The Star Guardian Janna succeeds in some areas but fails in others.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>This skin lacks a con</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>8. Sacred Sword Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="531" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sacred-sword-janna-skin-1024x531.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13269" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sacred-sword-janna-skin-1024x531.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sacred-sword-janna-skin-300x155.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sacred-sword-janna-skin-768x398.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sacred-sword-janna-skin-1536x796.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sacred-sword-janna-skin-150x78.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sacred-sword-janna-skin-750x389.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sacred-sword-janna-skin-1140x591.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sacred-sword-janna-skin.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Sacred Sword Janna transitions from being a maiden of the winds and turns into a master swordswoman, but it struggles to adapt to this. She wears a loose dress and a tiara on her dark hair, clothing, and hair aside it’s the classic Janna. There are subtle gusts of winds around her that aren’t eye-catching. Sacred Sword Janna isn’t anything too special but there is still a thing to like about her.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>This skin has all-new, models, particles, animations, and sounds, so if you dislike any of those, there’s a con.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>9. Bewitching Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="565" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bewitching-janna-skin-1024x565.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13264" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bewitching-janna-skin-1024x565.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bewitching-janna-skin-300x165.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bewitching-janna-skin-768x424.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bewitching-janna-skin-1536x847.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bewitching-janna-skin-150x83.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bewitching-janna-skin-750x414.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bewitching-janna-skin-1140x629.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bewitching-janna-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Bewitching Janna will have you wishing for Halloween time, with a witch feel and her familiar Zephyr further completes the Halloween feel. Straps of cloth are styled as bat wings, with stockings and a hat that are all eye-catching with their original styles. All of these details together make a mighty fine skin, with a charming feel but still lacks depth.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Once again, Janna outshines the cons.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Janna has a unique style and this is shown with her skins. Frost Queen Janna is a highly recommend skin, it doesn’t fail to succeed at the theme of winter. With re-colored particles and snowflakes, the skin perfects its theme. Hextech Janna is a quite good skin that has more than just a remodel. It doesn’t provide as much as other skins but is still appealing and suitable for her.</p>



<p>Star Guardian Janna embraces the magical girl role, however, it lacks. The skin does well with a new model, particles, and sound but the skin does need more features to fully complete the concept. Sacred Sword Janna was a completely different skin than what we usually see with Janna. The dilemma is that it stayed on the more magical side of things instead of embracing her sword mastery. The skin has things to like about it but it has difficulties fully executing the concept.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bewitching Janna is a skin that’s expensive but charming. Rather than taking advantage of the Halloween theme it plays it safe and makes sensible choices. It’s a skin that is brimming with squandered potential. Tempest Janna stands out for its brilliant re-imagining of Janna, giving her a darker personality. It also has the lowest price and manages to have an appeal to it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, if you enjoy a more silly skin rather than serious, Forecast Janna might be up your alley. While it’s not impressive, there’s no doubt it’s a fun skin and should not be ignored.</p>

<p>Twitch, the Plague Rat, will have you putting up the rat traps. This rat has style with many different concepts, because who said rats couldn’t be fashionable? In this review, you’ll find out all the best skins for our favorite rodent.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Kingpin Twitch</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kingpin-twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13218" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kingpin-twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kingpin-twitch-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kingpin-twitch-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kingpin-twitch-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kingpin-twitch-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kingpin-twitch-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kingpin-twitch-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Kingpin Twitch goes with the stereotype that rats are always criminals, not to say they wouldn’t be. Twitch gets a new look as a criminal chief, and it is debatable whether or not this is clearly shown. The crossbow is well done and matches the color scheme, and the eye patch helps provide aid in fulfilling the theme. The criminal aspect isn’t suggested as much as it should be. It’s a good skin for Twitch fans who don’t want to draw attention.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Major Model Changes</li><li>New particles</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>2. Whistler Village Twitch</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Whistler-Village-Twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13214" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Whistler-Village-Twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Whistler-Village-Twitch-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Whistler-Village-Twitch-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Whistler-Village-Twitch-skin-1536x906.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Whistler-Village-Twitch-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Whistler-Village-Twitch-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Whistler-Village-Twitch-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Whistler-Village-Twitch-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Whistler Village Twitch almost feels like it’s imitating the Classic Twitch with a crossbow similar to Kingpin Twitch. He goes for more colorful clothing and much lighter fur than his distinctive look. The light white fur feels like the only unique feature this skin has. Whistler Village Twitch isn’t a bad option, but it still feels a little mundane.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Major Model Changes</li><li>New particles</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>3. Medieval Twitch</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/medieval-twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13219" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/medieval-twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/medieval-twitch-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/medieval-twitch-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/medieval-twitch-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/medieval-twitch-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/medieval-twitch-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/medieval-twitch-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Medieval Twitch isn’t your average rat, and he also goes medieval. He wears armor that appears to be merely thrown together; he has a small quiver that supplies him with arrows and bolts. This helps keep the idea of this weapon being a crossbow. None the less the skin feels uneven and not as appealing as you would expect. Medieval Twitch is still an okay skin and good for battle.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Major Model Changes</li><li>New particles</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is: Refer a friend reward.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>4. Gangster Twitch</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Gangster-Twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13216" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Gangster-Twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Gangster-Twitch-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Gangster-Twitch-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Gangster-Twitch-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Gangster-Twitch-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Gangster-Twitch-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Gangster-Twitch-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Gangster Twitch is a more elegant rat than the normal Plague rat. He opts for formal clothing like a striped suit, shoes, and fedora. The leather gloves and colors combined all give it a nice touch to prove the concept. His crossbow gets a new alternative style as a gun, which is a nice change. The skin is nice if you can ignore the flaws.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Major Model Changes</li><li>New particles</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>5. Vandal Twitch</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vandal-Twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13223" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vandal-Twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vandal-Twitch-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vandal-Twitch-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vandal-Twitch-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vandal-Twitch-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vandal-Twitch-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Vandal-Twitch-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Vandal Twitch embraces his new look as a punk gang member. He styles his hair as a Mohawk and has a beard. The clothes go for a punk aesthetic with a jacket that has the Deadly Venom logo on the right arm. In addition to the belt, there is a chain adorned with Molotov cocktails. This theme gives the rodent a more dangerous look, helping to aid this is a shotgun. It has only moderate changes for its high price, but it’s a good option for fans of Twitch.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Changes</li><li>New particles</li><li>New sounds&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>6. Pickpocket Twitch</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pickpocket-Twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13221" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pickpocket-Twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pickpocket-Twitch-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pickpocket-Twitch-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pickpocket-Twitch-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pickpocket-Twitch-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pickpocket-Twitch-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Pickpocket-Twitch-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Pickpocket Twitch has rocket raccoon shaking in his boots, as this skin gives him a look as a thief who is perfect for the rat persona. The skin comes off more cartoonish than anything else and gives a playful feel. The alternative to his crossbow is a revolver, and he wears a simple outfit perfect for a thief. Pickpocket Twitch is an appealing skin that is nice for all the fans that adore Twitch.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animation</li><li>New Sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>You can be a raccoon in battle. Are there really any cons?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 750 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>7. Samsung White Twitch</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/samsung-white-twitch-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13222" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/samsung-white-twitch-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/samsung-white-twitch-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/samsung-white-twitch-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/samsung-white-twitch-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/samsung-white-twitch-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/samsung-white-twitch-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/samsung-white-twitch-skin.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Samsung White Twitch gives twitch a more modern look. It pays tribute to a player named Imp. The skin lacks anything unique, which is to be expected for something with a modern take. If the reference to Imp isn’t appreciated, then many will see the skin as boring and simple. Twitch’s style is still kept, and the modern look doesn’t stop at clothes as it travels to the crossbow. Unfortunately, the skin is a simple tournament skin that lacks and is just a remodel. So, if you don’t want to be a rat in modern clothing, move to the next one.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>It lacks appeal</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>8. Omega Squad Twitch</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/omega-squad-twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13220" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/omega-squad-twitch-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/omega-squad-twitch-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/omega-squad-twitch-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/omega-squad-twitch-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/omega-squad-twitch-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/omega-squad-twitch-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/omega-squad-twitch-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Omega Squad Twitch keeps his personality with a mutated rat persona. He wears night goggles, a gas mask, and he has a toxic rifle rather than a crossbow. He wears a long coat with normal clothes under it and long boots. His grenades are now modern but still sticks with the toxic theme of the skin. The skin can feel uneven at times, but if you overlook that, the skin is appealing. The particles add a nice touch, the sounds follow the theme, and the recall draws attention. Omega Squad Twitch suits his personality and is a fine skin.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>This skin is too good to get a con.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>9. Ice King Twitch</strong></h2>

<p>Ice King Twitch will have you feeling cold, as the skin gives the aesthetic of ice. The colors are vibrant, with light blue and a darker blue to match the ice theme. He has an ice jaw, but it doesn’t seem very eye-catching unless you really look. His crossbow goes for a fantasy look and isn’t much help at assisting the ice concept. Other than the colors, there isn’t much to prove the theme except the snowflake particles. The skin is appealing for lovers of winter and the plague rat.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The price</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>As you can tell, Twitch is a rat with style. The skin we highly recommend is Pickpocket Twitch. It’s appealing and gets the point across. The skin is also charming and has a low price. The alternative is Gangster Twitch, it gives Twitch a new look involving elegance which isn’t perfect for his personality, but it’s still appealing. Another good option for you Twitch fans is Vandal Twitch, as it offers an appealing aspect. It also has a dangerous feel to it; however, the price is a bit expensive for the lack of features.</p>



<p>Kingpin Twitch is a good skin for you to get on sale; the look offers a different style than what we’ve previously seen. Samsung White Twitch was a tournament skin for tournament fans. The tribute gives the skin some appeal, but other than that, it’s a pretty simplistic skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, we have Omega Squad Twitch, this skin has many eye-catching features. The skin could have had more done to it and feels as if they didn’t take advantage of the theme, a great skin for Twitch players, but it is rather expensive. Lastly, we have Ice King Twitch. The ice theme is clearly stated through colors and particles, but that’s about it. It could have been expressed more, but it’s still a good concept for the Plague Rat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lulu, the Fae Sorceress, and her familiar Pix have a wide variety of skins and the ability to change the look of your enemies. If you have an obsession with glitter, this Fae is for you, and this skin review will help you figure out which one of these skins you will be wearing to feel fabulous.</p>



<h2><strong>8. Bittersweet Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bittersweet-Lulu-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13170" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bittersweet-Lulu-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bittersweet-Lulu-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bittersweet-Lulu-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bittersweet-Lulu-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bittersweet-Lulu-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bittersweet-Lulu-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bittersweet-Lulu-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bittersweet-Lulu-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Bittersweet Lulu is a pretty sweet costume, pun intended. Lulu gets a whole new look as well as her fairy Pix to match the theme. In addition to the low price, you can turn your enemies into cupcakes, which sounds like a win to me.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New models</li><li>New sound for Whimsy</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>7. Wicked Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wicked-lulu-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13176" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wicked-lulu-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wicked-lulu-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wicked-lulu-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wicked-lulu-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wicked-lulu-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wicked-lulu-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wicked-lulu-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wicked-lulu-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This lulu has a bit darker theme than her usual style. The theme travels to her polymorphs as they become cats. It’s an appealing skin that doesn’t over exaggerate. Wicked Lulu is a magnificent skin that stays simple but still manages to fulfill the concept.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New models</li><li>New sound for Whimsy</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>6. Dragon Trainer Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="603" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dragon-trainer-lulu-1024x603.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13172" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dragon-trainer-lulu-1024x603.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dragon-trainer-lulu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dragon-trainer-lulu-768x452.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dragon-trainer-lulu-1536x905.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dragon-trainer-lulu-150x88.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dragon-trainer-lulu-750x442.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dragon-trainer-lulu-1140x671.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/dragon-trainer-lulu.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>While Dragon Trainer Lulu might sound like a big change, it doesn’t stray far from her classic self. Rather than focusing on Lulu, it centers on Pix with animations that are too subtle to notice. While Pix got new animations, Lulu went for a more human look and matched it with golden attire. This skin is for all you Pix lovers out there.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New models</li><li>New animations</li><li>New particles</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The one thing this skin is lacking in is a con.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>5. Winter Wonder Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/winter-wonder-lulu-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13177" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/winter-wonder-lulu-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/winter-wonder-lulu-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/winter-wonder-lulu-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/winter-wonder-lulu-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/winter-wonder-lulu-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/winter-wonder-lulu-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/winter-wonder-lulu.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Winter Wonder Lulu is a skin that managed to fill every aspect of the concept, from the clothes to the snow particles, everything screams snow and ice. It may be a normal costume with unoriginal colors, but it’s still rather appealing. While the skin itself might be amazing, the price for the feature is far too high. However, it’s still highly recommended.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New models</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>And again, this skin is just that amazing to the point that there are no cons.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>4. Pool Party Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pool-party-lulu-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13174" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pool-party-lulu-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pool-party-lulu-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pool-party-lulu-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pool-party-lulu-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pool-party-lulu-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pool-party-lulu-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pool-party-lulu-skin.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Pool Party Lulu is a charming skin with a new theme, water. This skin manages to stick with her playful vibe while also adapting to her normal style. The gear is everything to be expected with a pool party, a swimsuit, inflatable armbands, and a swim ring. However, she gets a large squid hat, clam staff, and Pix is now an inflated pufferfish. In addition to this, she gets new particles and new animations. It’s not a perfect result, and the price is a bit expensive, but the skin is still appealing and manages to capture her naughty personality.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New models</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The only con I have is the overabundance of cuteness that you’ll have to put up with during battle.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>3. Star Guardian Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-lulu-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13175" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-lulu-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-lulu-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-lulu-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-lulu-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-lulu-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-lulu-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-lulu-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/star-guardian-lulu-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Star Guardian Lulu has a rather tinker bell feel to it. She wears an almost traditional look of a sailor, with a star ribbon on the neck and star topped feathered tiara to perfect the star concept. Pix also gets an adorable look; together, they embrace the innocence of Lulu. This skin lacks Lulu’s normal mischievous personality; it’s a good skin but misses the feeling of fulfillment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New models</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>This skin once again opted out on having a con</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>2. Cosmic Enchantress Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="598" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cosmic-enchantress-lulu-skin-1024x598.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13171" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cosmic-enchantress-lulu-skin-1024x598.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cosmic-enchantress-lulu-skin-300x175.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cosmic-enchantress-lulu-skin-768x448.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cosmic-enchantress-lulu-skin-1536x896.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cosmic-enchantress-lulu-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cosmic-enchantress-lulu-skin-150x88.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cosmic-enchantress-lulu-skin-750x438.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cosmic-enchantress-lulu-skin-1140x665.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Cosmic Enchantress Lulu may seem like a complicated skin, but the concept is rather attractive and suitable for the Fae Sorceress. She rocks a helmet with a braid hidden behind it, with golden decorations. The staff doesn’t seem to match the colorful design of the helmet. This skin lacked the ability to combine her playfulness and the grimness that the skin should have been. The result is still appealing with lacking in some areas, but still a decent skin.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New models</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>We’re on a roll of no cons</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>1. Pajama Guardian Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pajama-star-guardian-lulu-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13173" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pajama-star-guardian-lulu-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pajama-star-guardian-lulu-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pajama-star-guardian-lulu-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pajama-star-guardian-lulu-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pajama-star-guardian-lulu-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pajama-star-guardian-lulu-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pajama-star-guardian-lulu-skin.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Lulu is the only character that could get away with wearing pajamas in the battlefield. The pajamas use the design of Pix, as the hood makes it large and noticeable. Unfortunately, the rest of her skin, except her large eye-catching wings, isn’t so easy to see. Her familiar, Pix and her staff stay almost identical to a previous skin, the star guardian. This is a perfect skin for Lulu as it suits her personality.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New models</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>You’ll be making everyone envious of this skin</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Lulu’s skins allow us to have a wide variety of changes for her familiar and polymorphed enemies. Wicked Lulu is the highly recommended skin with its traditional look that might appeal more to most people. But Bittersweet Lulu is also recommended, with a more playful look that’ll have you craving sweets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Trainer Lulu is a skin that must be appreciated for its changes for it to be considered a great purchase. Winter Wonder Lulu has a nice look but it doesn’t entirely match up to its high price. Not a horrible skin, however, there should be more for its price. Pool party lulu has a charming feel that’ll have you constantly drawing to this skin. The water theme was perfectly executed and expresses her playfulness.</p>



<p>Star Guardian Lulu takes a different turn than usual. Sadly the skin fails to take advantage of Lulu’s personality. While it is undeniably charming, it fails to be different. Cosmic Enchantress</p>



<p>Lulu lacks the grimness it intended for. It has nice features, however once again the skin fails to accomplish her personality. Pajama Guardian Lulu is a skin that expresses her personality and mischief on a large scale. The skin is adorable and appealing, so it’s a good option.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>League of Legends has, in recent years, focused a lot on their music department. They’ve released various songs and albums in more than one genre. But what stood out amongst them was the immensely popular K/DA “band.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Comprised of a female-only lineup, K/DA has amassed <strong>hundreds of millions of </strong>views across multiple songs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Naturally, League’s developer – <strong>Riot Games</strong> – implemented these “band members” into the game as purchasable skins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five characters enjoy these cosmetic treats. Namely, they are Kai’sa, Evelynn, Ahri, Akali, and, most recently, Seraphine. The former 4 were original members, and Seraphine is new in the lineup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve compiled just the right list as some of the game’s best skins visually (and musically!)—the 7 Best K/Da Skins in League of Legends. Though the characters are only 5, many skins are offered, and the number is expanded with variations such as Prestige editions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Without further delay, let’s begin with our glorious musical ranking.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>7. K/DA ALL OUT Ahri&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-ahri-skin.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13152" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-ahri-skin.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-ahri-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-ahri-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-ahri-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-ahri-skin-750x422.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Starting off with a more basic skin, Ahri’s K/DA ALL OUT is a nice skin but sits rightfully at the very bottom.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An upgrade over the original K/DA option for this character, this skin is probably the only one where this is the case. ALL OUT upgrades, for me personally, do not look the part, especially when compared with their previous iterations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What they do offer, though, are a ton of <strong>Chromas</strong>. This skin, in particular, offers 8 (eight!) Chromas to choose from, making it a skin that is likely to suit everyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As said above, the skin is nice, but visually and musically, it can be better, and we hope that Riot, with further K/DA development, releases a more competent skin to the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This skin will set you back <strong>1350 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>6. K/DA Akali</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="600" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-akali-skin-1024x600.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13151" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-akali-skin-1024x600.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-akali-skin-300x176.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-akali-skin-768x450.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-akali-skin-1536x899.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-akali-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-akali-skin-150x88.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-akali-skin-750x439.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-akali-skin-1140x668.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Despite being just one spot above the previous skin, it is better by a mile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The animations and music that follows them are superb and pleasing to see and hear. It makes Akali much more intimidating. Her W – <strong>Twilight Shroud</strong> – transforms her character into the much-loved neon version seen in the K/DA Music Videos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from that, which alone could set her on this list, her other spells enjoy much of the same level of quality. What stands out is the music, as will be the case with all of these skins (especially at the end, but keep reading to find that out).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Akali does have an ALL OUT version of her K/DA persona, and despite offering a variety of Chromas, it is simply not as good as this beautiful skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This skin costs <strong>1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>5. K/DA Evelynn</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="600" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-1-1024x600.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13156" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-1-1024x600.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-1-300x176.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-1-768x450.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-1-150x88.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-1-750x439.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-1-1140x668.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>It seems like there are scarcely any lists that do not include League’s notorious seductress. Whether we are talking about AP, Assassins, or a range of other topics, she finds her way into the conversation just like she does into your Mid Lane.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But I digress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The K/DA Evelynn skin comes with all the musical vampire glory that you’d expect. With bombastic sound effects and an enhanced <em>sly</em> laugh as she creeps up behind you, this skin just deserves a top 5 place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her passive form turns her into the neon pink demon we saw in the Music Videos, which is definitely one of her best looks yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This skin will cost you <strong>1350 RP, </strong>and we highly recommend you grab it if you’re an Evelynn player.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. K/DA ALL OUT Evelynn</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-evelynn-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13153" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-evelynn-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-evelynn-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-evelynn-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-evelynn-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-evelynn-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-evelynn-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-evelynn-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-evelynn-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>You thought we were done with Evelynn? Well, you thought wrong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ALL OUT iteration of Evelyn’s K/DA persona is more of a sound upgrade rather than a visual one. This iteration adds crisp new sound effects and some visual changes that complete the Evelynn K/DA look perfectly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now with more of a blue than neon pink hue, Evelynn looks ice cold and ready to pierce your heart with her crystals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As is tradition with ALL OUT skins, this one will also give you a range of Chromas to choose from. They are the same ones mentioned in our <strong>Number 7</strong> on this list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is not much to say about this skin other than it is a total upgrade over the original, and it will set you back <strong>1350 RP </strong>at the League of Legends store.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>3. K/DA ALL OUT Kai’sa</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="1024" height="595" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-kaisa-skin.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13154" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-kaisa-skin.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-kaisa-skin-300x174.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-kaisa-skin-768x446.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-kaisa-skin-150x87.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-kaisa-skin-750x436.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Kai’sa also enjoys a new ALL OUT look, fashioned with blue crystals and new crisp sounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sound effects are similar to other ALL OUT skins, and visually the skin overall looks very pleasing and intimidating to face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What really stands out in terms of sound quality are her Q and E. The Q, especially when upgraded, is a musical masterpiece, sounding a lot like a synth solo. Her E also has a beautiful, short effect that completes her already audible kit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This skin will set you back <strong>1350 RP </strong>in the store and offer only one Chroma, which is unique compared to other ALL OUT skins.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. K/DA Kai’sa</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-kaisa-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13157" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-kaisa-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-kaisa-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-kaisa-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-kaisa-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-kaisa-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-kaisa-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-kaisa-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The K/DA skins are few and far between. Therefore a repeat of Champions was warranted when this article was thought up in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of my favorite skins overall for one of my favorite Champions, the K/DA Kai’sa classic persona is something else. If others had bombastic sound effects, this one has <strong>Nuclear</strong> and will make you fear for your life if she manages to engage you with her Ultimate – <strong>Killer Instinct. </strong>That spell alone has a sound effect worthy of a spot on the list, and it sounds <em>fantastic.</em></p>



<p>Kai’sa also has a great Q, similar to her ALL OUT iteration. It is an eargasm, to say the least. Combined with other sound effects (and visual beauties) they form eye and ear candy glory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Kai’sa persona will set you back <strong>1350 RP </strong>and does not offer any Chroma variations. It does have a <a href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Prestige_Point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige edition</a>, though, but it cannot <em>currently</em> be obtained. </p>



<h2><strong>1. K/DA ALL OUT Seraphine&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-seraphine-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13155" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-seraphine-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-seraphine-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-seraphine-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-seraphine-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-seraphine-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-seraphine-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-seraphine-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-all-out-seraphine-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Our previous contender would be the best of the best were it not for this insane <strong>Ultimate Skin</strong> for Seraphine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are barely any words to describe how good this skin is, and it represents the peak and epitome of K/DA skins released so far.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It has three variations that can progressively be unlocked with custom-built missions that you get access to by buying this Ultimate skin. You will follow the story of Seraphine starting up as an <strong>Indie </strong>singer and her journey through the ranks of a <strong>Rising star</strong> and finally becoming a true K/DA <strong>Superstar.</strong></p>



<p>This skin has new animations, sound effects, and visuals, and two new exclusive icons, an emote, and a border that’s unlocked through her questline. It changes <em>everything</em> about the character and Champion and is truly a marvel, like other Ultimate Skins currently in the game.</p>



<p>It will set you back a whopping <strong>3250 RP,</strong> which is almost 2.5 times the price of other K/DA skins, but I believe it is worth it for the reasons mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The K/DA lineup is one of our favorites to listen to and watch, be it in the game or Music Videos. It was not easy to pick and choose the best one (apart, of course, from Seraphine), and we are sure some of you will not agree with our list. We, therefore, apologize to Popstar Ahri fans of yore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, for those that love K/DA as much as we do, but don’t see their favorite on the list, don’t miss out on letting us know everything you think about the topic. We always love to hear your thoughts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Evelynn, Agony&#8217;s embrace, follows along a dark path in her personality. She maintains charm in her behavior and always dresses to impress. Evelynn makes it difficult to not be star-struck by her. In this review, find out which skins will have you looking the best.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Shadow Evelynn</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shadow-evelynn-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13117" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shadow-evelynn-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shadow-evelynn-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shadow-evelynn-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shadow-evelynn-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shadow-evelynn-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shadow-evelynn-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shadow-evelynn-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/shadow-evelynn-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Shadow Evelynn presents Evelynn as a vampire. The vivid and colorful clothes stand out on her pale skin, which is part of the vampire concept. Her particles get a darker hue to them that are just re-colored. Shadow Evelynn almost resembles classic Evelynn, which is fine as it keeps her personality. The recall involves her posing as she leaves into a dark mist. It&#8217;s a great skin that is appealing and has her personality written all over it. Shadow Evelynn is a skin that is perfect for Evelynn lovers.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New Model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>There&#8217;s nothing to hate with this skin, the price is low, and the skin is packed with features.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>2. Masquerade Evelynn</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/masquerade-evelynn-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13115" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/masquerade-evelynn-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/masquerade-evelynn-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/masquerade-evelynn-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/masquerade-evelynn-skin-1536x906.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/masquerade-evelynn-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/masquerade-evelynn-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/masquerade-evelynn-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/masquerade-evelynn-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Masquerade Evelynn displays Evelynn with a set of different clothes. She wears a dress and a mask, clearly presenting the theme. The gold lines the clothes that contrast nicely to her light skin. She has red hair that further helps the theme. The skin still manages to reflect her personality. However, Masquerade Evelynn is just a basic remodel that fulfilled the concept. The skin does, unfortunately, lack features. It&#8217;s an excellent skin for its price.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>3. Tango Evelynn</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tango-evelynn-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13118" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tango-evelynn-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tango-evelynn-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tango-evelynn-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tango-evelynn-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tango-evelynn-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tango-evelynn-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/tango-evelynn-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Tango Evelynn gives her a look as a Tango dancer. The theme travels to her hair, the red dress, roses, and even her shoes. It goes nicely with her demonic nature. Particles match the color of the dress with dark red petals. With the particles and the clothes, it brings the entire skin’s concept to life. Tango Evelynn finely represents her charming identity and is perfect for battle.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>

<p>Safecracker Evelynn presents her as a thief, which does help the mischievous personality of Evelynn. She wears a tight suit that looks to be a darkish blue, and her hair is bright pink; the colors are a nice contrast to her pale skin. The skin isn&#8217;t original, but it&#8217;s perfect for Evelynn. Particles have a dash of electricity in each of the abilities. Overall there isn&#8217;t too much that displays the thief aspect, but it still remains a nice skin.</p>

<p>Blood Moon Evelynn shows her as a demon which is fitting. The adaptation has her wear revealing clothes with tendrils that suit her. The skin doesn&#8217;t seem to focus on the darkness of the concept. A concept of which is suiting and appealing for Evelynn, however, the skin lacks in many areas. The particles are now red, so it matches the theme. Sounds are only limited to Demon Shade. A new animation being the recall has her playing with a moon that seems to be made of blood. Blood Moon Evelynn isn&#8217;t horrible skin, but it&#8217;s also not perfect, as the skin feels like wasted potential. Overall, lovers of Evelynn will love this demonic skin.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<h2><strong>6. K/DA Evelynn</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13114" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/kda-evelynn-skin.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>K/DA Evelynn gives us a new look that we don&#8217;t normally see, Evelynn as a K-Pop idol. She wears modern clothes with lashers, further helping the modern feel. Particles are now re-colored and vivid. During Hate Spike, gold against black manages to always be eye-catching. Much of her abilities are noticeable. Sounds fail to communicate with her theme as a K-Pop idol, but that&#8217;s fine as you still get new amazing sounds. Her new recall has her dancing with what resembles a disco ball effect on the floor. K/DA Evelynn is a fun skin with some interesting features; it just feels a little empty-handed.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New Models</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Fails to fulfill the theme</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The highly recommended skin is Shadow Evelynn; it shows her personality and has some excellent features. Many fans of Evelynn will happily embrace the Shadow Evelynn skin. Tango Evelynn is full of charm. It almost resembles her classic look and is still appealing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Safecracker Evelynn is a skin with an interesting concept, but it failed to show the thief theme. But there&#8217;s no doubt that it&#8217;s still an appealing skin and perfect for fans of the look. Masquerade Evelynn is a nice option that is an essential remodel. The concept is an ideal look for Evelynn as it shows her personality nicely.</p>



<p>Next, we have Blood Moon Evelynn, a skin that didn&#8217;t focus on the theme of the skin, but that doesn&#8217;t make it a horrible skin. The skin has some appealing features and looks attractive, and it even suits her personality. Lastly is K/DA Evelynn, a skin that is packed full of features but fails to recognize the theme and lacks in the musical aspect. The result of the skin is still eye-catching and suitable for Evelynn fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grey Warwick can be seen as a pretty simplistic skin, but it&#8217;s so much more than that. It gives him a werewolf look with armor and a spectral sword. The colors of everything match the theme. Making this skin even better is new particles that are very subtle and fit the colors of Grey Warwick. Overall, the skin is very nice for those that do manage to obtain it. It has little to offer, but there&#8217;s no doubt that it looks amazing.</p>

<p>Urf the Mantee displays Warwick in Urfs skin; it&#8217;s an adorable skin for the monster. He has a Gatling gun on his back, and he simply wears Urfs skin.

<p>Tundra Hunter Warwick portrays him as a frosty werewolf while keeping his personality. The model is pretty similar to the classic Warwick and the only changes are the little bit of gear that he has. He has ice shards on his back, indicating the ice theme. His most distinct feature, being his white fur, is aided by his new particles for his abilities. The addition of the frost sounds for his abilities helps present the theme. In all, Tundra Hunter Warwick is a nice skin that had low ambitions, but regardless, it&#8217;s still appealing even if it doesn&#8217;t aim to be much.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Changes</li><li>New particles</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations</li></ul>

<p>Feral Warwick is a chemically enhanced werewolf, which is an interesting take for Warwick. The design of the outfit is simple and fits his theme. The canisters are full of what seems to be chemicals on his back, which does a nice job at adding something unique to the feel of the skin. His fur is brown, with some scars on his left shoulder. The skin almost feels cartoony and less serious. Feral Warwick also gets some new particles. The skin stands out despite all of its flaws and the classic feel being kept to it. It’s a great skin that Warwicks fans will enjoy if you can obtain it.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Changes</li><li>New particles</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new animations&nbsp;</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>

<p>Firefang Warwick, you had your ice wolf; now here&#8217;s a fire wolf. Much of the classic Warwick is still noticeable, and that&#8217;s okay. The fire theme is finely interpreted. Warwick gets a new look as an orange/red werewolf that has rock plates as his armor. On his back is a volcano that is eye-catching. Particles leave trails of flames behind and are amazingly done. The sounds are subtle with the fire theme. Considering all of this, Firefang Warwick has much to offer with style, particles, and sounds. The skin looks good, even if it does feel like it lacks. Firefang Warwick is appealing for you lovers of the fire look.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Change</li><li>New particles</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>

<p>Hyena Warwick gives off a post-apocalyptic style as well as a mad max look. He has a Mohawk, goggles, trousers, and gear that appears to be makeshift, as well as a mechanical hand. This skin allows him to have a punk personality, and to complement the hyena concept is the random laughing that his actions bring.

<p>He may seem like your average werewolf, but nope, he&#8217;s an armored bandit wolf. Marauder Warwick is a werewolf in armor, making for a dangerous look. Most of him is covered in armor except his feet, tail, and ears as well as his neck. The armor seems to want to provide protection in only certain areas, but the gear seems more decorative than anything. While the skin does lack many features, it&#8217;s still an appealing skin. The design doesn&#8217;t go overboard and remains somewhat interesting. Marauder Warwick is a skin that many will find that they adore.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lunar-guardian-warwick-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13047" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lunar-guardian-warwick-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lunar-guardian-warwick-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lunar-guardian-warwick-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lunar-guardian-warwick-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lunar-guardian-warwick-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lunar-guardian-warwick-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lunar-guardian-warwick-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lunar-guardian-warwick-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Lastly, is Lunar Guardian Warwick shown as a celestial protector. He is covered in decorations that are anything but simplistic. His armor or his decorations are all eye-catching and fun. The skin is different than what we normally see. Particles are changed with different shades and some floral patterns for some abilities. There are very few changes to the sounds as the classic base of the sounds is practically untouched. His recall displays Warwick closing a gate that&#8217;s decorated. Overall, Lunar Guardian Warwick is a nice appealing skin. It&#8217;s eye-catching and lacks in the dullness. Lunar Guardian Warwick is a skin that is easy to fall in love with.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animations</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>I can’t seem to find a con for this skin</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 1350 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Tundra Hunter Warwick is the one that is the most eye-catching as it has a distinct look and is pleasing to have. Hyena Warwick gives a new fun identity to him as a post-apocalyptic hyena. The skin is unique in the idea of the concept. Firefang Warwick is a skin with much to offer. This skin should definitely not be overlooked as it is packed full of features and it’s appealing.</p>



<p>Marauder Warwick is a skin that doesn’t go overboard but is still interesting. Feral Warwick closely resembles the classic Warwick, but this doesn’t make it a terrible skin. The skin is appealing and nice to have. Lunar Guardian Warwick is different than previous skins as it shows him in decorations and gives him a new look.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grey Warwick is a pretty basic skin, but it shouldn&#8217;t be overlooked. The concept of the skin is normal and nothing too remarkable. Urf the Manatee is a skin that gives a more fun feel to Warwick than his serious personality.</p>

<p>Prestige skins are some of the rarest skins in the game. Obtainable through limited-edition events and <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-quickly-get-key-fragments-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hextech crafting</a> (which can prove pretty expensive), they are certainly unique and are not often seen in action on the Rift. </p>



<p><strong><em>But what are they, exactly?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>They are unique versions of already existing skins with a new golden color and accent splashed onto them. They also pack new particle effects along with other recoloring and changes. Think of them like VERY special chromas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you happen to have one on your hands by any stroke of chance, you might wonder just how good and rare your skin is. Well, wonder no longer, as we&#8217;ve compiled a list of the Top 10 Best Prestige Skins ranked from worst to best. So, here we go.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>10. Prestige K/DA Kai&#8217;sa&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-kaisa-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13010" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-kaisa-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-kaisa-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-kaisa-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-kaisa-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-kaisa-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-kaisa-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-kaisa-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The K/DA songs are among some of my favorite. The catchy beat and godlike Korean rap solos hit differently. Encapturing the spirit of K/DA as a band is K/DA Kai&#8217;sa in all of her golden Prestige splendor. Though perhaps not as visually pleasing as some other contenders for the number 10 spot, the MUSICALITY of the skin alone soars her above the rest. Explosive sound effects, often in quick succession, make for some of the most pleasing to use spells and attacks in the game.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>9. Prestige K/DA Evelynn&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="599" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-evelynn-skin-1024x599.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13009" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-evelynn-skin-1024x599.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-evelynn-skin-300x176.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-evelynn-skin-768x450.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-evelynn-skin-1536x899.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-evelynn-skin-150x88.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-evelynn-skin-750x439.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-evelynn-skin-1140x667.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-kda-evelynn-skin.jpg 1845w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Following Kai&#8217;sa is her band member K/DA Evelynn. No list would be complete without a blood lusty vampire lady, especially not without one that&#8217;s also a KPOP group member. Similar to Kai&#8217;sa, the skin is very musical, but what makes her stand out just a tad bit more are the beautiful animations that tend to make you forget you are facing a nosferatu. Perhaps that is another of her seductive tricks to make you face-check that brush for the fifth time. Who knows.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>8. Prestige Firecracker Vayne&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="640" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-vayne-prestige-edition-skin-1024x640.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13006" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-vayne-prestige-edition-skin-1024x640.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-vayne-prestige-edition-skin-300x188.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-vayne-prestige-edition-skin-768x480.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-vayne-prestige-edition-skin-1536x960.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-vayne-prestige-edition-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-vayne-prestige-edition-skin-150x94.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-vayne-prestige-edition-skin-750x469.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firecracker-vayne-prestige-edition-skin-1140x713.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>To counter the predecessor, we bring in the Rift&#8217;s infamous vampire hunting ADC. The firecracker skin itself makes room for a spot in just about any skin list out there, but with the unique Prestige particles and accent, it is just that much better. This one is one of those that is an all-around upgrade from the original. Instead of dark orange and black, she now sports a beautiful gold and white combo, making the skin stand out among others. In true traditional Chinese fashion, Prestige Firecracker Vayne is a nightmare of the Rift, now triple-shotting you with golden rockets and firecrackers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>7. Prestige Fuzz Fizz</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuzz-fizz-splash-art-prestige-edition-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13007" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuzz-fizz-splash-art-prestige-edition-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuzz-fizz-splash-art-prestige-edition-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuzz-fizz-splash-art-prestige-edition-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuzz-fizz-splash-art-prestige-edition-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuzz-fizz-splash-art-prestige-edition-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuzz-fizz-splash-art-prestige-edition-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuzz-fizz-splash-art-prestige-edition-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fuzz-fizz-splash-art-prestige-edition-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>There is just something simultaneously so cute and macabre about a murderous puppy. Pair that with another just as ferocious, larger hound, and you&#8217;ve got Fuzz Fizz. With Prestige glory and in golden clad, the dangerous AP Carry makes you extra reluctant to kill him, as he&#8217;s just so damn cute. But, you will quickly have a change of heart, as this puppy means business.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>6. Prestige Project: Irelia&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="928" height="522" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-project-irelia-skin.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13011" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-project-irelia-skin.jpg 928w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-project-irelia-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-project-irelia-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-project-irelia-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-project-irelia-skin-750x422.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" /></figure></div>



<p>If you&#8217;re an avid gamer, this skin will almost certainly remind you of 2B, the main character of the critically acclaimed Nier: Automata. It is a great RPG, and you should play it when on pause from your daily climb and grind. As in Nier, this skin is all about the future. The animations are excellent, as Irelia&#8217;s kit has a superb kit that fits the Project vibe. But, what makes this skin stand out is the sound. Explosive, intimidating, and borderline awesome, the spell sound design of this skin is a true treat.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>5. Prestige PsyOps Ezreal</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-psyops-ezreal-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13012" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-psyops-ezreal-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-psyops-ezreal-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-psyops-ezreal-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-psyops-ezreal-skin-1536x906.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-psyops-ezreal-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-psyops-ezreal-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-psyops-ezreal-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-psyops-ezreal-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>We all like colors, and this skin is the epitome of color. PsyOps Ezreal paired with the Prestige effects is a charm to look at with a neon vibe all around him. This quick hybrid ADC looks genuinely striking in this special iteration with a well-rounded, well-designed, and great-sounding skin.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Prestige Conqueror Jax&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/conqueror-jax-prestige-edition-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13005" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/conqueror-jax-prestige-edition-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/conqueror-jax-prestige-edition-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/conqueror-jax-prestige-edition-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/conqueror-jax-prestige-edition-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/conqueror-jax-prestige-edition-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/conqueror-jax-prestige-edition-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/conqueror-jax-prestige-edition-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/conqueror-jax-prestige-edition-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Jax is a simple champion, perhaps TOO simple. So much so that most of his skins look very bland. His kit lacks any actual animations and effects to be changed or upgraded, but they managed to pull it off. Green suits his entire character well, adding much to his overall looks. But the real standpoint is the all-new effects attached to his spells, which are stunning, to say the least. Though watch carefully as this tanky brute tends to go through them fast.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>3. Prestige Dark Star Malphite</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-dark-star-malphite-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13008" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-dark-star-malphite-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-dark-star-malphite-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-dark-star-malphite-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-dark-star-malphite-skin-1536x906.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-dark-star-malphite-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-dark-star-malphite-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-dark-star-malphite-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-dark-star-malphite-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>If you were scared from a large rock ulting you from the fog and seemingly at random, your fears are about to turn to terror. Turned into an armored black hole (that throws many more, smaller ones around), Dark Star Malphite with the Prestige effects is a cosmic horror to face. His recall animation is one of the best you can find that barely manages to stand out apart from the rest of the kit that sports equally as good effects that make this skin unique.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Prestige Valiant Sword Riven&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-valiant-sword-riven-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13014" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-valiant-sword-riven-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-valiant-sword-riven-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-valiant-sword-riven-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-valiant-sword-riven-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-valiant-sword-riven-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-valiant-sword-riven-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-valiant-sword-riven-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Perhaps the most beautiful skin overall that I&#8217;ve so far listed, Riven&#8217;s Prestige edition is something else. The recall animation is probably the best one yet, challenged only by the previous contender. With bright and beautiful colors and animations, it gives Riven a much-needed uplift in graphical fidelity and quality that adds a lot to the fun and the character herself.</p>

<h2><strong>1. Prestige True Damage Senna&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-true-damage-senna-skin-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13013" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-true-damage-senna-skin-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-true-damage-senna-skin-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-true-damage-senna-skin-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-true-damage-senna-skin-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-true-damage-senna-skin-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-true-damage-senna-skin-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-true-damage-senna-skin-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/prestige-true-damage-senna-skin.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Senna&#8217;s Prestige skin is truly what Prestige skins are meant to be in all of her Louis Vuitton glory. Most think of them as glorified chromas, which, in a sense, they are. But skins such as this one make us believe otherwise, and rightfully so. The animations, the looks, everything about it looks stunning and expensive, or, should I say &#8211; Prestige. If you&#8217;ve got your hands on this one, you truly possess one of THE best skins in League of Legends right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That was our list of the Top 10 Best Prestige Skins ranked from worst to best. Which one is your favorite? Be sure to let us know.&nbsp;</p>
