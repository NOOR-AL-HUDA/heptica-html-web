										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Assassins in League of Legends are those Champions that make you crap your pants. If you’re an ADC, squishy support, or any other low defense role/class, Assassins can ruin your life. Whenever you see them approaching, or even in the distance, you know they’re coming for you.</p>



<p>League’s grim reapers come in many different shapes and sizes. We’ve covered the <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-assassins-in-league-of-legends" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 Best Assassins in League of Legends</a></strong>, where we went over the generally best picks. In that list, there was a strong presence of AD Champions, including the number one spot. </p>



<p>But, as is the case with many League of Legends classes, AP Champions are there too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this list, we’ll go over the best AP Assassins in the game currently. Their playstyles usually don’t differ too much, but if left unhinged, their damage certainly can be a sight to behold. Though not really if you’re on the receiving end.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let us begin with our list.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>7. Akali</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13585" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-akali.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Akali is a solid Champion to play as, though perhaps not so intuitive. Her kit is fairly straightforward, and you have the mobility to do the classic in-and-out tactic without breaking a sweat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her damage, like the rest on the list, is remarkable. She will often take the Conqueror rune, allowing her to heal for days and make your life miserable. You will often meet her on the Top Lane, and while she does excel against most classes, she can struggle against bruisers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Picking a good tank that can outlast her in fights and trade blows with her is paramount to winning. Keep in mind that Akali does tend to pull out a few tricks from her sleeve and deal damage/heal unexpectedly. She can Lane and will scale strongly into the late game, so beware of her when she picks up an item or two.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>6. Ekko</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13587" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-ekko.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>I include Ekko so low on this list because of how boring he is to play with/against. Of course, this is my opinion, so I’m sorry to any Ekko mains out there that might be reading this list. But I digress.</p>



<p>Ekko is a strong mage Assassin that can be pretty difficult to Lane against. He has a nice, though a bit difficult to land, poke, and can close gaps easily with his E. His W is a skill-shot shield <em>and</em> can be a stun if he catches you in the area. The stun seemingly lasts forever, so be advised and stay away from it when you see it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His R is a nightmare to deal with. He can rewind time and heal back to full if he lands it right. This more or less means you have to kill him twice or that he’ll escape most of the fights he’s in. Apart from that, it also deals a ton of damage in the area he goes back to. Ekko is one of those Champions that <em>really </em>make you have to build up your defenses. Tenacity and MR are core to countering his otherwise strong <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> and Damage.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Evelynn</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13588" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-evelynn.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>She somehow seems to find her way into most of these champion lists. This just proves how versatile, and fun this Champion is (or just how biased I am towards her, whichever suits you best). League’s seductor epitomizes the Assassin role, utilizing invisibility and shadows to achieve her goals. </p>



<p>As I said, Evelynn prowls the darkness of the Rift and strives within it. Until level 6, she will be completely visible to everyone at all times. Level 6 comes by fast, so prepare to be ganked into oblivion. Evelynn is what I like to call – an executor. This means her entire purpose is to finish you off without using too many spells. Yes, she has her W purported for ganks and utility, but her E and R are well enough to do the job most of the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Q is there too when the enemy is running away and providing an easy proc of your W whenever the need arises. The W also amplifies the damage from the abilities that proc it, making it a great tool to amplify your damage in various situations.<strong> </strong>Be sure to buy those Control Wards if you wish to survive this invisible menace.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>4. Diana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13586" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-diana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Ever since her kit was shuffled around a bit, Diana has become very fun to play. Though I rarely, if ever, play her, I like seeing her on my team. The opposite is true when she’s part of the enemy roster, and I dread the very moment I started the queue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Diana can be very difficult to play against, and that’s an understatement. If you’re a melee Champion, especially one that has a poor early game, expect to be tossed around the Lane like you were nothing but a toy. She can keep her distance and deal constant, low cooldown damage with her Q. It’s a great poke and is not easy to dodge once you’re in range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She can subsequently close the said gap using her E, do severe damage, shield herself with her W, and pull you in and blast you with her Ultimate. Her ability to engage in large groups of enemies and use her amazing kit to CC all of them makes her one of the best team fighters in the game. This is the exact reason why you should consider focusing her down before big fights in the late game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Fizz</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13589" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-fizz.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This maritime devil makes me hate myself. I usually play Gangplank or Twisted Fate mid, and people just always pick this stupid Champion. It’s infuriating and an instant loss of the Lane, at least early on. That is where Fizz shines. He prevents you from enjoying/functioning during the laning phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He can poke, dodge, go in, go out. Everything you can think of, Fizz can do. I know very few ways of fighting against him, so I advise you to pick him rather than opting to go against him. If, by chance, you do meet him, tell your jungler to camp the Lane. Slowing down or stopping Fizz’s rather quick <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-snowballing-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="10383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowball</a> will help you and your time have a greater chance of containing and defeating him. </p>



<p>Watch out for his roams, though, as he can come back as fast as you put him down. A few kills are all it takes to make or break games, so don’t be reluctant to beat him while he’s down.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>2. Kassadin</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13590" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-kassadin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Kassadin is secretly one of the most broken champions in League of Legends. He broke the game more times than I could count, and he keeps doing it to this very day. Whenever I play him, I see enemy players going wild in all chat with various messages, pleasant and unpleasant alike. </p>



<p>They have a good reason for this, as Kassadin is one of the most severe cases of snowballing in the history of League of Legends. He doesn’t exactly have the best laning phase or early game. His strength lies in the post 20 minute period, where he likely will have a stacked-up Seraph’s Embrace or at least one mythic item like Luden’s Tempest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are his power spikes, and with each item, he just keeps growing. The reduction of his Ultimate’s mana cost from 800 to 640 at max stacks will also help you stay in the fight for a while longer. Mana is your biggest handicap, so going for items with the highest mana efficiency is key to keeping yourself dormant and dominant. I also suggest taking Fleet Footwork to give yourself some healing later on, which you will certainly lack.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Katarina</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13591" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-AP-assassins-in-lol-katarina.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This Champion fails to be anything but the best in her class. She’s simple, easy to pick up and play, and doesn’t have too much about her that’s necessarily complex. Sure, learning some of those wild combos and dashes that would give anyone motion sickness is not easy, but it isn’t exactly rocket science either.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Katarina has a good laning phase that can win against most opponents. However, some on this list can likely beat her in Lane but can never snowball as fast and easy as she does. Snowballing is a reoccurring theme with assassins. Their items are not too expensive, and getting kills is super easy considering their kits were tailored around it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Katarina is the queen of roams, and she will roam to every part of the map you can think of. Most Katarina players focus on the bottom Lane, especially if it is losing. Strengthening the position of your other lanes while keeping the mid Lane secure and stable will help you limit and stop Katarina’s snowball. Being this map-aware and present is excruciatingly difficult for a jungle player, especially a lower elo one, so give it your best to limit her as much as possible or accept a defeat and move on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Whether they be AP or AD, Assassins are Riot’s favorite class. If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be meta picks for God knows how long now. Hopefully, they die down a little bit, and actually, good roles will come into fruition, but until then, we can only join them and play the best of the best.</p>



<p>Let us know what your favorite Assassins in League of Legends are. Are they AP? Would you include them on this list, and why? We always love to hear from you, so don’t miss out on letting us know what you think.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karthus, the Deathsinger, may be undead, but he still knows how to be stylish with his skins. Karthus is a character with a unique personality that allows room for many different types of skins. Let this skin review help your decision on what to bring to battle when you play Karthus.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Phantom Karthus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="512" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13562" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-1024x512.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-300x150.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-768x384.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-1536x768.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-150x75.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-360x180.jpg 360w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-750x375.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/phantom-karthus-1140x570.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Phantom Karthus displays Karthus as a lich or a battle mage. His outfit consists of him covered in armor, and he wears a tattered black robe that helps the lich theme. While the skin doesn&#8217;t present itself with much originality, it&#8217;s rather appealing for its visuals and its low price.

<h2><strong>2.&nbsp; Statue of Karthus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13563" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/statue-of-karthus-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>While the skin has a unique concept, the Statue of Karthus does fail to appeal. The theme is unique in that it gives a lich a Statue of Liberty look, which can be seen as a little whimsical. Considering it’s an American symbol, it&#8217;s bound to not appeal to everyone worldwide. The look is an interesting take on Karthus; it can be adored by fans in America or that simply love the look.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Changes</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 520 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>3. Grim Reaper Karthus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="512" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-1024x512.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13559" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-1024x512.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-300x150.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-768x384.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-1536x768.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-150x75.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-360x180.jpg 360w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-750x375.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/grim-reaper-karthus-skin-1140x570.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>We can&#8217;t have a lich without presenting himself as the grim reaper. It&#8217;s a fitting skin for his personality and characteristics; the execution is nicely done with realizing the theme of the Angel of Death. The model accomplishes the concept’s appearance, which is nothing more unique than what you normally see with a Grim Reaper. Grim Reaper Karthus doesn&#8217;t go above and beyond, and that&#8217;s okay, as the skin already is appealing. Lovers of the look and Karthus will find this skin perfect for them.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13561" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pentakill-Karthus-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Pentakill Karthus displays him as a heavy metal singer, which is another skin that suits his personality. His outfit is attractive and elegant; he wields a staff that is now a microphone. Pentakill Is a skin that is always entertaining and a nice tribute to heavy metal fans that many will appreciate. While the skin isn&#8217;t too unique of a concept, it&#8217;s still charming.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Moderate Model Changes</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li></ul>

<h2><strong>5. Fnatic Karthus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13558" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/fnatic-karthus-skin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Fnatic Karthus gives him a colorful look like a warlock in what seems to be a modern look. The skin is elaborate and somewhat unique. The modern aspect feels a bit lacking, and the skin is all about your preference. Fnatic Karthus is a decent option if you enjoy a new modern look for him; other than that, it doesn&#8217;t present itself with many features.</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>Major Model Changes</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>No new particles</li><li>No new animations</li><li>No new sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 750 RP.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>6. Karthus Lightsbane</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="602" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-1024x602.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13560" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-1024x602.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-300x176.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-768x451.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-1536x903.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-150x88.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-750x441.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karthus-Lightsbane-skin-1140x670.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Karthus Lightsbane gives him another warlock look; it’s a different interpretation for Karthus. Rather than looking dead, he looks alive, giving away his lich persona. The white hair contrasts nicely with the clothes, with a gothic look for any outfit. Robes are decorated, shoulders add a nice touch, and the staff gets a new look. Everything is rather different than the classic Karthus. Particles represent runic patterns, and the sounds give an eerie, haunting sound. The sounds match the theme quite nicely. Karthus Lightsbane isn&#8217;t that extraordinary, but the idea is different and unique. His fans will find the skin to be appealing for battle.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>New Model</li><li>New particles</li><li>New animation</li><li>New sounds</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>The skin is unique, so there isn&#8217;t much of a con to it</li></ul>



<p><strong>The price of this skin is 975 RP.</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The highly recommended skin is Grim Reaper Karthus; the idea matches his persona. It embraces him in a dark look as the Angel of Death. Phantom Karthus represents him as an undead battle mage. The skin is appealing and inexpensive, making it a good choice.</p>



<p>The Statue of Karthus is a skin presenting itself as a less serious look for Karthus. The look isn&#8217;t for everyone as it&#8217;s the Statue of Liberty, an American symbol, but the look still is somewhat appealing. Pentakill Karthus is a nice skin for those that enjoy the genre. It’s appealing and suiting for Karthus, as it matches his personality. Many will come to enjoy this skin.</p>



<p>Karthus Lightsbane is a skin that is straight to the point, with nothing too special. The visuals are appealing and are packed full of features, but it’s nothing out of this world. Fnatic Karthus is a modern Karthus that is lacking in anything special. The skin will be overlooked unless you&#8217;re someone that happens to enjoy the look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>League of Legends has no shortage of unique characters and exciting-to-play picks. And while there are<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-many-champions-are-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> over 150 champions </a>in the game right now, not all of them are on the same pedestal. Some champions are widely beloved and enjoyed by nearly all players. And some champions are generally hated, even without a good reason. So in this post, I&#8217;ll go over the 10 most popular champions in LoL from the beginning of the game up to this point!</p>



<p>Keep in mind that it&#8217;s totally possible for your champion to not be on the list. After all, we all have different tastes and playstyles when it comes to LoL. Some of us like assassins, and some of us only play mages.</p>



<p>However, the 10 champions I&#8217;ve chosen here are the most popular ones in LoL, not only because I say so. I&#8217;ve actually looked at the data behind their pick and ban rate, as well as their general status within the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/why-is-league-of-legends-community-so-toxic/" data-type="post" data-id="9044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">League community</a>.</p>



<p>So, take a look at the top 10 most popular champions in LoL!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Ezreal</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13543" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-ezreal.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Ezreal</strong> is statistically the most played and the most beloved champion in League of Legends. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether you are an ADC main or not; chances are that you enjoy playing Ezreal. He&#8217;s quite a fun character to be close to, and he constantly says cheesy and funny lines such as:</p>



<p><em><strong>&#8220;Name&#8217;s Ezreal. E-Z-… oh, you&#8217;re dead.&#8221;</strong></em></p>



<p>A big reason why Ezreal is such a famous champion is the fact that he is an all-skillshots champion. It takes focus and skill to carry as Ezreal, so he always gives you a reason to try harder. In short, he is a difficult to master but very fun champion to play. And most people love him!</p>



<h2><strong>2. Lee Sin</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13545" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lee-sin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The second on this list is <strong>Lee Sin</strong>. Since the beginning of League of Legends, Lee Sin has been the favorite champion of nearly all junglers on the Rift. And why shouldn&#8217;t he be? Lee Sin is perhaps the most interesting champion to play and has 4 fun abilities combined into one brilliant champion design!</p>



<p>The thing that most people love about Lee Sin is the fact that this champion is simply unlimited. You can play him for years, yet there will always be something to improve and work on.</p>



<p>For example, you can start by practicing the Insec kick. You can then dedicate time to the Flash kick. And then you can work on your Ghost kick. There are multiple builds and ways to play this champion, so it&#8217;s always fun to jump into a game with him!</p>

<h2><strong>3. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13550" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-thresh.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Thresh</strong> is, to this day, the most unique and the most influential pick in the support role. Thresh paved the way for a new support playstyle that still has the name &#8220;carry supports&#8221; when he first came out. And in season 11, Thresh is still the reigning king of popularity among the support champions.</p>



<p>Thresh has multiple things that make him fun. First of all, his Q is an awesome hook-like ability that gives 9999 satisfaction when you aim at an enemy champion. And his lantern is one of the greatest spells invented in League of Legends. But all of his abilities fit Thresh&#8217;s champion design perfectly, and we&#8217;ll always find him exciting, no matter the meta!</p>



<h2><strong>4. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13546" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Next, we have <strong>Leona</strong>! As much as Thresh is unique in the support role, Leona is the very opposite. She is a standard tank support champion that has never been reworked or changed in any significant way. Leona is simply always powerful and able to carry games by constantly setting up kills for her teammates.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve ever played Leona, then you know how fun it is to always be the aggressor in the lane. You are the one that dictates the flow of the laning phase, and you&#8217;re the one that needs to engage first. Flying forward with your E and stunning the enemy ADC so your partner can take the kill can&#8217;t be replaced, honestly!</p>



<p>People seem to love her playstyle, and that&#8217;s why Leona is one of the most popular champions in LoL!</p>



<h2><strong>5. Lux</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13548" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lux.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Back in the day, before champions like Zoe or Vex existed, <strong>Lux</strong> was the only long-ranged mage we had in League of Legends besides Xerath. She&#8217;s always been such an exciting character to play, thanks to her wonderful ability mechanics.</p>



<p>Anyone who enjoys playing mages in LoL should give Lux a chance. She can be played both as an AP carry and as a support mage. She works well with most team compositions, so you can fit her everywhere.</p>



<p>All of Lux&#8217;s abilities have a low cooldown, and you can practically spam them, which is always fun. And you can use her ultimate to snipe enemies from a safe distance. All in all, a great champion to enjoy League of Legends with!</p>



<h2><strong>6. Vayne</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13551" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-vayne.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Besides Ezreal, <strong>Vayne</strong> has also been one of the most played ADCs. And unlike Ezreal, Vayne is also played in the top lane, especially as a counter to tanks and melee bruisers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vayne has an extremely high skill cap, which means that you must put a lot of time and effort into practicing her before you can actually play her on a decent level. However, Vayne is also highly rewarding if you do know how to play her. And that makes her a very interesting champion to spend your time with.</p>



<p>People also love the fantasy behind Vayne&#8217;s playstyle. She is a shadow hunter that uses tricks like tumble to avoid her enemies and only strike them from a distance. And playing her like that feels very satisfying to most players!</p>

<h2><strong>7. Yasuo</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13552" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-yasuo.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Yasuo </strong>is a &#8220;special&#8221; case on this list because he is one of the most hated and most popular champions in LoL. The reason why he is hated is that not too many players are actually good at playing him. And the reason why they love him is that playing Yasuo is a total blast, no matter how good you are.</p>



<p>Yasuo has multiple dashes, a wind wall to block abilities, a tornado, and a game-winning ultimate. But he became so popular because he was the first samurai character we ever received in LoL. He embodies so many characters that we love from anime, which is one of the biggest connections why players love Yasuo.</p>



<h2><strong>8. Irelia</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13544" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-irelia.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Irelia</strong> has been a part of League of Legends since the very beginning. And even before her rework, she was one of the most popular top lane picks in the game. Currently, Irelia is a much more difficult champion to play, but that&#8217;s why she is even more fun too!</p>



<p>Irelia is a blade dancer, a creating plays with her often feels like doing art. Connecting two blades to stun your enemies and dashing all around with your Q feels very satisfying. People love the fact that they can outplay nearly anyone as Irelia, so they play her a lot too!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>9. Miss Fortune</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13549" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-miss-fortune.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Miss Fortune </strong>is another ADC champion with skyrocketing popularity in League of Legends. And even though she&#8217;s never been reworked and has a fairly simplistic ability kit, we simply love playing her!</p>



<p>The most satisfying part of playing Miss Fortune is her ultimate, Bullet Time. This has always been one of the scariest abilities in the game, simply because it can kill all 5 enemy opponents if used correctly. We often play Miss Fortune just for the chance to score a pentakill with her R. And even though it doesn&#8217;t happen every game, we&#8217;re satisfied with double and triple kills too!</p>

<h2><strong>10. Lucian</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13547" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/most-popular-lol-champions-lucian.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And in the last place, we have <strong>Lucian</strong>. Lucian has been such an instrumental part of the marksmen&#8217;s design that we often see him as a primary example of how these types of champions should be created.</p>



<p>Lucian was released during season 3. And since then, he&#8217;s been one of the most fun ADCs to play. His passive, which allows him to double-shot after every ability, is simply awesome. His dash is a fantastic tool for avoiding damage, and his ultimate is loaded with an insane amount of damage.</p>



<p>Lucian is the original gunner on Summoner&#8217;s Rift, and he&#8217;ll remain to be so in the years to come!</p>



<p>Those are the top 10 most popular champions in LoL!</p>

<p>Have you ever outplayed, out-smarted, and out-gunned the enemy champion in your lane, and just when you are about to close in for the kill with that final perfectly timed attack, a teammate of yours that happened to be lurking nearby swoops in and steals the kill? I bet you have and you know how irritating that can be. To do all the hard work and then have someone else steal all the glory right before your eyes. This is called Kill stealing or KS-ing for short.</p>



<p>This is a phenomenon not just in League of Legends but in other games as well. In some games, the experience and gold or in-game currency you earn depends on the damage you did and not whether not the final killing shot was by you. However, in League of Legends, all of the gold goes to the killer and that can make it frustrating. Good team-mates will not steal your kill but if you have a toxic cry-baby among your ranks, you can expect a lot more KS-ing.</p>



<p>Sometimes, during team fights, it&#8217;s often not clear who is going to get the final kill when everybody on your team is trying to kill everyone on the enemy team. KS-ing can be forgiven in such scenarios. When you are chasing down an enemy and he seems to be getting away from you, a teammate coming to ensure the kill should not really be considered KS-ing. At times, the support to the AD-carry sets up the kill but ends up taking the kill. If that happens only once in a while, it&#8217;s not KS-ing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if the support is continuously trying to take your kills if someone from your team withholds using his high-damage abilities and uses them only when the enemy is at very low heath, that is the textbook definition of KS-ing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So you&#8217;re playing a game, you push your lane in the top, you win your lane, have your objectives under control, and see your <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bot lane duo</a> popping off. You breathe a sigh of relief because you think the game is already won, then you suddenly see a Vayne double kill; no big deal, you&#8217;re winning; that&#8217;s what matters. Then you see another Vayne kill announcement and another and another, and all of a sudden, their Vayne is killing your entire team. She has farmed her core items and is now snowballing her team to victory; what do you do? Is there a way to stop this? Is there a way to prevent this? Well, if you&#8217;re asking yourself that question, you are reading the right article because I will show you all the ways you can counter Vayne and prevent her <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-hyper-carries/" data-type="post" data-id="9744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyper-carry </a>late game. Read on as we study her skills and different champions and items to counter her.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Vayne&#8217;s Abilities</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Passive – Night Hunter –</strong> Every time she moves towards enemies, she gains a bonus movement speed, perfect for chasing down enemies and dodging skillshots.</li><li><strong>Q – Tumble – </strong>Vayne tumbles to a certain location. She then gains a bonus attack damage on her next basic attack. This is perfect for positioning and even dodging enemy spells cast on Vayne. She can also use this to chase enemy champions even faster.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>W –</strong> <strong>Silver Bolts</strong> – With every basic attack, Vayne puts this stack on the enemy champion. On the third stack or third hit on the same unit, Vayne deals true damage on the enemy depending on its max health. Attacking a different unit would transfer the stack instead of to that unit, and the stack would back to one. This works perfectly against champions with lots of armor.</li><li><strong>E </strong>– <strong>Condemn – </strong>Vayne can cast condemn on enemies, which will push them back. If the enemy hits a terrain when pushed, that champion is stunned for a certain duration, depending on Vayne&#8217;s level. Condemn also puts a stack of silver bolts on the enemy.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>R – Final Hour – </strong>With her ultimate skill, Vayne unsheathes her large crossbow on her back, and she gains bonuses on her skills. Vayne gains a flat amount of physical damage and also doubles the movement speed she gains from her passive. Every time Vayne uses a tumble, she becomes invisible, and the cooldown of her tumble is also greatly reduced.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>As you might hear from different videos or read from different articles, the best way to know your way around a champion is to play it yourself; that way, you can get familiarized with its strengths and weaknesses. This way, when playing against a Vayne, you&#8217;ll know when her vulnerable moments are, how to lane against her, and even different factors. Now let&#8217;s move on, knowing the champions to use against Vayne especially early game. Vayne&#8217;s early game is very weak so harassing her early game with ADC champions with long-range or junglers with high mobility is a great way to shut her off. So let&#8217;s take a look at the candidates.</p>

<h2><strong>Best Champions That Counter Vayne in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Ashe</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13532" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-ashe.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Vayne primarily loses to champions with very long ranges, and Ashe specializes just like that. She has a very long base attack range that has a passive that slows every enemy she hits with her basic attack. With this, you can easily win an early game matchup with Vayne by bullying her in the lane. Ashe also has her W ability which fires a volley of arrows that damages and slows enemies hit with it. Vayne would really have a hard time facing Ashe in the early game, even so in the late game when Ashe farms faster than Vayne</p>



<h3><strong>2. Lux / Caitlyn duo</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13534" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counters-lux-caitlyn.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This bot lane composition has many ways to counter and kill vayne many items, be it early or late game. With Lux being aggressive support, she can zone Vayne out of the minion exp range. Lux can also cast her Q ability to root Vayne. Caitlyn can follow up on her W&#8217;s ability to further the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowd control</a>. The duo can burst her down with this. If Vayne manages to get away, both champions have very long-ranged ultimates, which they can both use to secure the kill on Vayne. This bot lane duo is very effective from early to late game.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Shadow Assassin Kayn</strong></h3>

<p>Vayne is considered a glass cannon, which means in exchange for her very high damage output in the late game, she is squishy and easy to kill throughout the game. So it means she is very susceptible to assassinations of champions such as Kayn with very high burst potential. With Kayn, you can surprise Vayne wherever she is with your ability to walk through walls. Suppose you choose to be blue Kayn or shadow assassin Kayn. In that case, you can easily build lots of lethality items and literally one shot vayne with your basic combo and passive; if she manages to survive, you can cast your ultimate to finally finish her off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With all that in mind, these are just a few champions to counter Vayne; with this next section of the article, I will teach you the general counters for Vayne to figure out which champions counter her.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Best Tips On How To Play Against Vayne</strong></h2>



<ul><li>Outranging her would put her at a very huge disadvantage.</li><li>Build anti-heal items because Vayne uses lifesteal to make up for her squishy nature.</li><li>Burst champions like assassin mages and assassin junglers are champions made to counter glass cannons like Vayne</li><li>Champions with gap closers and crowd control abilities lock her down in one place.</li><li>Immediately using exhaust on Vayne just before a fight erupts is the perfect way to counter her, slowing her down and bringing her damage output down to 60%.</li><li>Constant harassment would prevent her from farming, thus shutting her out of the game.</li><li>Wave management to put her in a very susceptible position to ganks so you can repeatedly kill her.&nbsp;</li><li>Don&#8217;t pick champions with no gap closer against her as she would just run around and hit you, and you will never get to touch her.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Best Items to Counter Vayne in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Duskblade of Draktharr</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="592" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-1024x592.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13529" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-1024x592.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-300x173.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-768x444.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-150x87.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-750x433.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr-1140x659.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-duskblade-of-darktharr.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This item is the best friend of almost all assassins. It deals bonus damage to champions that have not seen you in a while. Champions like Shaco can surprise Vayne with his burst damage along with Dark Harvest and Duskblade. With this item&#8217;s high damage and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/lethality-league-of-legends-how-does-it-work-updated/" data-type="post" data-id="7321" target="_blank">lethality</a> passive, you can surely burst Vayne before she can even do some damage to your team. Sometimes, the best defense is killing the enemy fast enough they won&#8217;t have time to react.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>2. Frozen Heart</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="577" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-1024x577.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13530" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-1024x577.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-768x433.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-150x85.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-750x423.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart-1140x642.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-frozen-heart.jpg 1182w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>This item is great for champions that rely on basic attacks and attack speed. Not only will this item slow Vayne&#8217;s attack speed down, but it would also help mitigate her very high damage output because of the large amount of armor it gives.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Thornmail&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="529" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-1024x529.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13531" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-1024x529.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-300x155.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-768x396.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-150x77.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-750x387.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail-1140x588.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-vayne-counter-items-thornmail.jpg 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The only way to counter Vayne&#8217;s damage is through building lots of armor and lots of health and sustain. With thorn mail, you can have both, and it&#8217;s passive that reflects damage, which is perfect because Vayne relies mostly on her basic attacks. This item also inflicts grievous wounds on champions that hit the wearer with a basic attack, also a great way to counter her lifesteal.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>After everything you have read, you should know how to stop a Vayne from <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-snowballing-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="10383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowballing</a> by now. After all, if a Vayne gets fed and is practically doing a 1v9, you lose the game unless your team focuses on locking her down with stuns and roots. Vayne deals a percentage of health, so tanks really aren&#8217;t that great against her too, so working as a team will always be the best way to counter her. After all, league of legends is a team game and should always be played to win more frequently. Thank you for reading and GLHF summoner; see you on the rift.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A League of Legends match is usually divided into three parts &#8211; <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/tips-for-better-early-game/" data-type="post" data-id="9785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early game</a>, mid game, and late game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The early game is the actual laning phase, where we measure our skill with our lane opponents. The mid game is when the first team fights happen, and this is the time that usually determines which team will have the gold advantages. But the late game decides which team is going to win the actual match.</p>



<p>And so, we often choose our champions based on how well they scale for the late game. We need to consider whether they&#8217;ll be strong enough to carry in the late game if we fail to win early on.</p>



<p>And League is full of <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-late-game-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="10542" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powerful late game champions</a>! However, there are picks that only do well in the early game. So today, I&#8217;ll be going over the 10 weakest late game champions in League of Legends and why you should avoid them!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s begin!</p>



<h2><strong>10. Renekton</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-renekton-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13520" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-renekton-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-renekton-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-renekton-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-renekton-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-renekton-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-renekton-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-renekton.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Renekton </strong>is easily the weakest late game champion in League of Legends. And it&#8217;s weird to admit this because he is perhaps the strongest early game pick in the entire game. But that&#8217;s the truth!</p>



<p>Renekton has a couple of strengths that really categorize him as a powerful early game champion. For example, he has a stun, dash, and amazing burst damage at level 3. Most opponents can&#8217;t even trade efficiently against Rene, so he dominates most matchups in the top and mid lanes.</p>



<p>However, Renekton doesn&#8217;t scale well at all. All of his stats are centered around carrying in the early game, creating advantages, and closing the game before the enemy gets the chance to catch up. And it&#8217;s pretty likely that once you get your core items, you can easily duel Renekton with most champions.</p>



<p>This, of course, doesn&#8217;t mean that Rene is completely useless either. It simply means that if you play Renekton, you better make sure you create enough gold and level advantage to always remain stronger than your opponent. And going even in lane is never an option for you because the longer the game goes on, the weaker you&#8217;re going to get in comparison to other players.</p>



<p>So, avoid playing Renekton if your games typically last longer than 25 minutes!</p>



<h2><strong>9. Ivern</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-ivern-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13517" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-ivern-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-ivern-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-ivern-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-ivern-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-ivern-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-ivern-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-ivern.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Ivern </strong>is perhaps the most unique pick in League of Legends. Half of the time, he doesn&#8217;t even fight. And the other half he spends in shielding allies or spawning brushes around the map. But why exactly is he one of the weakest champions in LoL too?</p>



<p>Well, Ivern isn&#8217;t a strong champion in the early game either. He is a support jungler that can only do one thing &#8211; help others carry him to victory. Seriously, Ivern has little to no damage, only a tiny bit of crowd control, and a pet that could tank the neutral objectives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, all of Ivern&#8217;s tools are useful for being efficient at clearing the jungle camps and taking objectives around Summoner&#8217;s Rift. But that&#8217;s it! He doesn&#8217;t have anything else that could really influence the team fight except for his shield.</p>



<p>Now, Ivern has never been a fighting champion. And he doesn&#8217;t have to be. But when it comes to the late game, we want the most powerful champions in our hands. And this is because we want the highest chances of winning the match.</p>



<p>So, Ivern is a big no-no if you want to carry your own games!</p>

<h2><strong>8. Lux</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-lux-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13518" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-lux-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-lux-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-lux-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-lux-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-lux-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-lux-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-lux.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>When I say that <strong>Lux</strong> is one of the weakest late game champions in League, I really consider her just as an example. Many mages in the mid lane that do particularly well in the early stages are not too powerful in the late game. And it&#8217;s understandable because their full power can often be unlocked at level 6.</p>



<p>Lux, in particular, is a long-ranged poke champion that has a fantastic burst. Her combo is phenomenal for quickly assassinating targets from a distance. And she does an insane amount of damage with just one or two items in the mid game.</p>



<p>However, once the late game comes, and most opponents have a bit of magic resist, Lux&#8217;s damage just falls off. Her combo doesn&#8217;t do nearly enough damage to slay everyone, and her basic abilities aren&#8217;t powerful enough without her ultimate.</p>



<p>In other words, everybody can survive Lux&#8217;s damage in the late game. Even ADCs aren&#8217;t at risk because they can counter Lux with items like Immortal Shieldbow. Its passive will protect them from her damage, so it&#8217;s easy to defeat Lux in the late game.</p>



<h2><strong>7. Sona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-sona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13521" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-sona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-sona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-sona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-sona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-sona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-sona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-sona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>With the introduction of Seraphine<strong> </strong>to League of Legends, <strong>Sona</strong> lost a lot of her identity in the game. And even though Riot Games has given her a couple of buffs since then, Sona is still one of the weakest champions of the game.</p>



<p>Sona doesn&#8217;t have too many particularly useful tools. For example, Sona&#8217;s W, Aria of Perseverance, heals allies, right? But its heal is significantly weaker than Soraka&#8217;s or Nami&#8217;s heals. Similarly, Soraka&#8217;s Q, Hymn of Valor, does an okay amount of damage. But Seraphine&#8217;s Q can be double cast, and it does more damage!</p>



<p>So, Sona doesn&#8217;t have any &#8220;special&#8221; strengths in League of Legends. And this is also the case in the late game when the only game-winning tool she has is Flash+ulti. Sona&#8217;s ultimate can be used to win team fights and even games, but it&#8217;s not very effective. And again, Seraphine&#8217;s R does the same job as Sona&#8217;s but has bigger width and range.</p>



<p>So, avoid Sona if you&#8217;re looking to climb in League!</p>



<h2><strong>6. Talon</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-talon-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13522" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-talon-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-talon-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-talon-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-talon-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-talon-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-talon-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-talon.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Talon </strong>is one of the oldest champions in League of Legends. His design is pretty simplistic, and he lacks strengths that allow him to carry the late game. True, Talon has a unique mechanic &#8211; his parkour-roaming playstyle, but that&#8217;s pretty much it.</p>



<p>Now, it&#8217;s important to understand that Talon doesn&#8217;t lack damage in the late game. He is an extremely efficient assassin that can easily eliminate the enemy carry. However, the way he deals the damage is predictable and easy to avoid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Talon doesn&#8217;t have the best escape mechanics. Every time he goes in for a kill, he has to save one or two abilities to get out afterward. In comparison, Zed can always switch back to his initial shadow, making him a much better pick overall.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Talon has trouble surviving in the early game. And unless he constantly roams and ganks the other lanes, he can&#8217;t really win. So in games where you stop Talon from doing that, you can easily win against him in the late game.</p>

<h2><strong>5. Caitlyn</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-caitlyn-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13516" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-caitlyn-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-caitlyn-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-caitlyn-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-caitlyn-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-caitlyn-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-caitlyn-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-caitlyn.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Since the dawn of time, <strong>Caitlyn</strong> has been the biggest bully ADC champion in the bot lane. She has a couple of strengths that make her exceptionally good at tormenting other marksmen in her role. For example, Caitlyn has the biggest auto-attack range out of all ADC champions, and she can use it to poke them out of the lane!</p>



<p>However, once the laning phase ends and Caitlyn can&#8217;t poke as much, her efficiency also drops. Sure, she still does good damage, especially if she&#8217;s successful with her traps. However, most marksmen do even more damage than her while also having better kits for surviving.</p>



<p>For example, Vayne almost always loses the laning phase to Caitlyn. But in the late game, Caitlyn can&#8217;t even come close to the efficiency that Vayne has. Vayne does incredible single-target damage; she can kite around and avoid damage from multiple people, which is not the case with Caitlyn.</p>



<p>Cait is also a pretty squishy target in the late game, even for an ADC. She doesn&#8217;t have ways to absorb damage, and her only escape tool is her E, 90 Caliber Net. And she&#8217;s not that great at scaling!</p>



<h2><strong>4. Xerath</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-xerath-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13523" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-xerath-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-xerath-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-xerath-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-xerath-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-xerath-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-xerath-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-xerath.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>We sometimes get overwhelmed by the amount of damage that <strong>Xerath </strong>has. But how many times have we seen Xerath win team fights in the late game? Not very often, right?</p>



<p>Xerath is a great champion overall with interesting and powerful abilities. And no matter whether you&#8217;re playing him in the mid lane or in the support role, he&#8217;s good at controlling the pace of the game. You can use him to poke your opponents out of the lane and take kills from a safe distance.</p>



<p>However, once the late game starts, Xerath&#8217;s damage drops too. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether he has Void Staff or not; his DPS is just not there. This is also backed up by the fact that every ability that Xerath has is a skill shot. And unless it&#8217;s your lucky day, you&#8217;re going to miss a few important hits here and there.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Xerath is another extremely squishy pick. He can&#8217;t duel anyone in the game, and he can&#8217;t fight unless his team is around him. His abilities can&#8217;t hurt a tank, so it&#8217;s best to go for another champion if you want to carry.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Bard</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-bard-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13515" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-bard-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-bard-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-bard-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-bard-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-bard-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-bard-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-bard.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Bard</strong> is one of the few enchanters in League that aren&#8217;t particularly good in the late game. In comparison to Karma, Soraka, and Lulu, Bard is literally nowhere near in power level. Yes, he has a healing ability, but it&#8217;s nothing compared to the amount of damage in the game.</p>



<p>So the reason why Bard is one of the weakest late game champions in Lol is that he can&#8217;t do anything too well. He has a stun, but the mechanic is super weird and often tough to hit. His escape tunnel can easily be turned to an advantage for the enemy team. And his Zhonya&#8217;s-like ultimate often does more harm than good.</p>



<p>In other words, there is no real reason why you should play Bard in the late game. And if enchanters are your playstyle, I&#8217;d definitely advise you for picks like Rakan or Lulu. You can use these champions to outplay your opponents and not just wait on your team to do everything.</p>



<p>Bard is definitely an interesting character, but I&#8217;d stay away from him if I&#8217;d wanted to climb as a support!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Nautilus</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-nautilus-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13519" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-nautilus-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-nautilus-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-nautilus-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-nautilus-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-nautilus-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-nautilus-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-nautilus.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Nautilus</strong> is another extremely powerful champion in the early game but also very weak in the late game. Generally, Nautilus carries the laning phase for his ADC. But he also expects his ADC to carry him in the late game. Why is that?</p>



<p>Nautilus has everything in the early game &#8211; God-like crowd control, a great amount of magic damage, and a large shield to absorb enemies&#8217; attacks. And he uses these strengths to create advantages in the bot lane.</p>



<p>However, Nautilus loses his damage as the game progresses because he builds as a tank and not as an AP carry. His shield can&#8217;t block all the damage that his enemies can do. And all he has is crowd control which can also be avoided by things like Zhonya&#8217;s Hourglass, Quicksilver Sash, or Mercury&#8217;s Treads.</p>



<p>So, Nautilus can&#8217;t do too much harm to you in the late game.</p>



<h2><strong>1. Zoe</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-zoe-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13524" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-zoe-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-zoe-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-zoe-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-zoe-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-zoe-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-zoe-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/weak-late-game-champs-zoe.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Many won&#8217;t agree that <strong>Zoe </strong>is one of the weakest late game champions in League of Legends. But the reality is &#8211; she is a very <em>niche</em> champion that only succeeds in certain situations.</p>



<p>For example, Zoe is pretty useless in team fights if she isn&#8217;t the one starting them. Zoe can&#8217;t do much in hectic situations because she requires a setup (her E) so she can one-shot the enemy (with her Q). If she needs constantly run after her opponents, chances are that she&#8217;ll also miss half of her skill shots.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Zoe&#8217;s damage in the late game isn&#8217;t enough to one-shot anybody, even though it&#8217;s the only playstyle that the champion can go for. And if Zoe can&#8217;t kill anyone with her E+Q combo, she isn&#8217;t good for carrying games either.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>And there you have it! These are the weakest champions in League of Legends from all roles and playstyles. Of course, many more picks could be added to this list, but I only gave you the top 10 picks in this category.</p>



<p>You should definitely avoid these picks if your games often reach the late game as I mentioned already. This doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t climb with them, but you should try to close the games early on if you play them. Good luck!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Truthfully, Kog&#8217;Maw has seen better days than season 11. His immobile tool kit is too vulnerable in today&#8217;s meta, where the burst damage is significantly higher than any other season of League of Legends. As a result, Kog&#8217;Maw requires specific supports that can make him viable and set him up for carrying. So in today&#8217;s guide, we&#8217;ll go over the top 3 supports that best suit Kog&#8217;Maw in season 11!</p>



<p>Typically, you want to pair Kog&#8217;Maw with a champion that can protect him. Although tanks can be pretty useful in team fights, they lack the necessary tools to push Kog&#8217;Maw through the laning phase. He&#8217;s got quite a short-range (before level 6) and doesn&#8217;t have any way of escaping CC other than side-stepping.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s talk about the 3 best supports for Kog&#8217;Maw and how to play them!</p>

<h2><strong>1. Lulu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13487" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-lulu.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Since the dawn of time, Lulu and Kog&#8217;Maw have been one of the<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-best-bot-lane-duos-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="6952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> most feared duos in League of Legends</a>. These two champions have an insane amount of synergy and work perfectly together, almost as if they&#8217;re were created for each other.</p>



<p>The first thing to understand here is how Lulu&#8217;s passive works. Whenever Lulu shields or speeds up an ally, her fae companion Pix will stick around the ally to deal bonus damage on each auto-attack. This mechanic is useful for all champions in the game, but with Kog&#8217;Maw it reaches new heights.</p>



<p>Kog&#8217;s W extends the range of his basic attacks and empowers them to deal bonus max health damage. On top of the additional damage from Pix, these auto-attacks can melt everyone, including tanks. Kog&#8217;Maw&#8217;s build in season 11 is packed with a lot of attack speed, so he doubles the value of these benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not all because Lulu also solves every other problem that Kog has a champion. Kog&#8217;Maw has no mobility &#8211; Lulu grants him movement speed; Kog&#8217;Maw is very squishy &#8211; Lulu gives him a shield; Kog&#8217;Maw can&#8217;t block <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a> &#8211; Lulu can knock everyone away from him. And that&#8217;s what makes her the best among the supports for Kog&#8217;Maw in season 11!</p>

<h2><strong>2. Morgana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13488" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-morgana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Morgana is partly aggressive and partly defensive support. What makes her truly terrifying is the abundance of crowd control and the ability to block the enemy spells. The latter is one of the most useful effects in the entire League of Legends, so Morgana is always among the best supports for Kog&#8217;Maw too.</p>



<p>Making Kog immune to CC while he spits powerful attacks that shred the enemy frontline is perhaps the strongest move you can do in LoL. Morgana frees Kog&#8217;Maw to move around the map and engage in team fights. But Morgana can also engage first and open the way for Kog&#8217;s heavy artillery.</p>



<p>Another thing that should be noted here is how well Morgana&#8217;s Q and R synergize with Kog&#8217;Maw&#8217;s skill shots, especially his R. Many ADC players underestimate the damage of Kog&#8217;s ultimate, mainly because it deals magic damage and not physical. But both the base damage and the AP ratio of this ability are seriously insane and Kog can kill anyone with it as long as he has mana.</p>



<p>In the bot lane, Morgana and Kog&#8217;Maw can play aggressively into almost any matchup, as long as Morgana makes good use of her snare and spell shield.</p>

<h2><strong>3. Janna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13486" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supps-for-kogmaw-janna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Janna and Kog&#8217;Maw is a very typical bot lane duo. You generally want to play this matchup as carefully as possible in the first few levels. Kog&#8217;s damage is considerably low in the early game and Janna has only one damaging ability &#8211; her W.</p>



<p>After level 6, this pair becomes more durable. Thanks to his ultimate, Kog can unleash a tremendous amount of damage as long as he is careful about his mana. And Janna has multiple ways of protecting Kog&#8217;Maw. Her shield has a very short cooldown and her ultimate is her reliable plan B.</p>



<p>But in the mid and late game, Kog&#8217;Maw and Janna are even more powerful. All Janna needs to do is to run around Kog&#8217;Maw and spam her shield. And all Kog has to do is deal damage from afar and be careful of the enemy assassins. It&#8217;s easier said than done, but that&#8217;s the principal idea of playing team fights with this duo.</p>



<p>And those are the 3 best supports for Kog&#8217;Maw in season 11!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>From its initial concept, the support role has completely transformed over the years. In the early days of League of Legends, supports were only &#8220;supports.&#8221; They were thrown into the game with one goal only &#8211; protect the ADC as he scales to the late game. And nearly all support items at that time were only helpful in managing your mana, so you could cast more heals and shields throughout the fights.</p>



<p>However, this is not the case anymore in LoL. The support role is currently a recommended one for carrying and climbing in ranked solo queue. It&#8217;s a versatile position that allows you to play almost any champion, build, or playstyle. And additionally, you can purchase many support items that actually make a difference in the game.</p>



<p><strong><em>But, which are the top 5 best support items in League of Legends?</em></strong></p>



<p>Well, it&#8217;s tough to say because different champions require different items to become carries. For example, Leona almost always goes for Locket of the Iron Solari, while Brand always goes for Liandry&#8217;s Anguish.</p>



<p>Anyway, in this post, I&#8217;ll only focus on the best support items in LoL that work well on most support picks in the game. And keep in mind that I won&#8217;t mention any removed item, no matter how OP it once was. All of these items are available in the live game, so you can always build them.</p>



<p>So, take a look at the list!</p>



<h2><strong>1. Mikael&#8217;s Blessing</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="384" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-mikaels-blessing-1024x384.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13479" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-mikaels-blessing-1024x384.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-mikaels-blessing-300x113.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-mikaels-blessing-768x288.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-mikaels-blessing-1536x576.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-mikaels-blessing-150x56.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-mikaels-blessing-750x281.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-mikaels-blessing-1140x428.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-mikaels-blessing.jpg 1642w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Mikael&#8217;s Blessing</strong> is easily the best support item in League of Legends. But people don&#8217;t build it nearly as often as they should. And in reality, Mikael&#8217;s Blessing is one of the most broken items you can get in the game.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why is this the case?</em></strong></p>



<p>Well, the whole purpose of Mikael&#8217;s Blessing is &#8211; it removes the crowd control effect from you or your targeted ally. And if it doesn&#8217;t like much like a broken effect to you, just remember that most deaths in League of Legends happen when the target is in stun, root, or fear.</p>



<p>Now, why is it important for a support to build Mikael&#8217;s Blessing?</p>



<p>If you could prevent half of your ADC&#8217;s deaths by the end of the game, you&#8217;ve done a pretty good job as a support. That denies gold and level advantages from your enemies, so it&#8217;s another form of supporting your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Mikael&#8217;s Blessing also grants some helpful stats, such as +15 ability haste, +100% base mana regeneration, +50 magic resistance, +20% heal and shield power. They help supports manage their mana and boost their heals and shields.</p>



<p>The truth is, all supports should build Miakel&#8217;s Blessing if the situation demands it. However, it&#8217;s mostly a recommended item to enchanters &#8211; those who already have ways to protect their allies through heals and shields.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are the champions that work best with Mikael&#8217;s Blessing: <strong>Soraka, Yuumi, Janna, Taric, </strong>and<strong> Sona</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>2. Moonstone Renewer</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="478" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-moonstone-renewer-1024x478.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13480" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-moonstone-renewer-1024x478.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-moonstone-renewer-300x140.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-moonstone-renewer-768x358.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-moonstone-renewer-1536x717.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-moonstone-renewer-150x70.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-moonstone-renewer-750x350.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-moonstone-renewer-1140x532.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-moonstone-renewer.jpg 1646w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>In the second place, we have <strong>Moonstone Renewer</strong>. At the start of season 11, Moonstone Renewer was the most broken item in League of Legends, not just among the support items. And even though Riot Games nerfed its healings, it&#8217;s still winning games by itself!</p>



<p>What makes Moonstone Renewer a pretty powerful item is the fact that you don&#8217;t need to use it. It&#8217;s actually a passive effect that heals your nearby allies in combat. In other words, every time you enter a team fight, you&#8217;re going to heal your allies for a significant amount simply by possessing this item in your inventory!</p>



<p><strong><em>How does this all work exactly?</em></strong></p>



<p>Well, for each second spent in combat, Moonstone Renewer will heal your most damaged ally for 7% of their missing health. However, this can stack up the more you fight. So the longer you stay in combat, the more you&#8217;re going to heal. At its peak, Moonstone Renewer can heal up to 35% of your ally&#8217;s missing health every second! And that&#8217;s insane!</p>



<p>Now, Moonstone Renewer is typically built on enchanter champions. This is because it boosts their healing/shielding potential significantly. But it&#8217;s also because they benefit from its raw stats too &#8211; +40 ability power, +20 ability haste, +200 health, and +100% base mana regeneration.</p>



<p>So if you&#8217;re playing a champion like <strong>Yuumi, Soraka, Karma, Nami, Lulu, </strong>or <strong>Seraphine</strong>, then definitely build Moonstone Renewer!</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s why Moonstone Renewer is one of the best support items in League of Legends!</p>



<h2><strong>3. Imperial Mandate</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="526" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-imperial-mandate-1024x526.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13477" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-imperial-mandate-1024x526.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-imperial-mandate-300x154.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-imperial-mandate-768x395.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-imperial-mandate-1536x790.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-imperial-mandate-150x77.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-imperial-mandate-750x386.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-imperial-mandate-1140x586.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-imperial-mandate.jpg 1642w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Imperial Mandate</strong> is the only item on this list that has nothing to do with healing, shielding, or protecting your ADC in any way. And despite that, it&#8217;s still one of the best support items in LoL too!</p>



<p>If you take a look at Imperial&#8217;s Mandate tooltip info, you&#8217;ll quickly realize why it&#8217;s so damn good.</p>



<p>Imperial Mandate is a mythic item that allows you to mark the enemy champions every time you hit them with a crowd control ability. This includes all slows, snares, stuns, fears… anything that immobilizes the opponent in any way.</p>



<p>And the mark that Imperial Mandate puts on the target can be broken by your ally if they auto-attack or cast an ability. The breaking of the mark actually causes a burst of damage to the opponent, and it grants you and your ally bonus movement speed.</p>



<p>But the best part about Imperial Mandate is that it actually doesn&#8217;t have an internal cooldown. This simply means that you can apply your mark every time you have your CC spell. It doesn&#8217;t matter when or whom you&#8217;ve hit recently. It works every time!</p>



<p>Now, there are champions for whom Imperial Mandate is now a must in season 11. For example, <strong>Morgana</strong> support is almost always expected to have one. However, you can also build it on <strong>Lulu, Lux, Sona, </strong>or <strong>Zyra</strong>.</p>



<p>Imperial Mandate is definitely better on an AP champion, simply because of its stats. It grants +40 ability power, +20 <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/difference-between-ability-haste-and-cooldown-reduction/" data-type="post" data-id="9901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ability haste</a>, +200 health, and +100% base mana regeneration. It&#8217;s one of the best support items in League of Legends, and it&#8217;s awesome to play the game with it!</p>

<h2><strong>4. Knight&#8217;s Vow</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="424" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-knights-vow-1024x424.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13478" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-knights-vow-1024x424.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-knights-vow-300x124.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-knights-vow-768x318.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-knights-vow-1536x636.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-knights-vow-150x62.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-knights-vow-750x310.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-knights-vow-1140x472.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-knights-vow.jpg 1648w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong>Knight&#8217;s Vow</strong> has been one of the most purchased support items in LoL for a couple of seasons now. Its design is fantastic, and I only wish that Riot would include more similar items to the game, such as this one.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to understand what Knight&#8217;s Vow does. If you have it in your inventory, you can use it to bind yourself with your ADC or another ally. While bound, your ADC will take 15% less physical and magic damage. But that damage will be redirected to you instead as true damage.</p>



<p>Now, no one likes receiving true damage in LoL. However, that&#8217;s why Knight&#8217;s Vow is only recommended to tank supports, such as <strong>Alistar, Braum, Thresh, Leona, </strong>or <strong>Rell</strong>. These champions don&#8217;t mind losing a bit of extra health in a team fight if it means that their ADC will live to deal damage.</p>



<p>Knight&#8217;s Vow has an interesting mechanic because it stops its effect when you&#8217;re below 30% HP. This guarantees you that the item won&#8217;t kill you if it just so happened that you lost some extra HP during the fight. Additionally, you will get bonus movement speed towards your bound ally if they&#8217;re below 50% HP themselves.</p>



<p>The stats that Knight&#8217;s Vow offers are +10 ability haste, +400 health, and +300% base health regeneration. It&#8217;s not the tankiest item, but it&#8217;s still a helpful purchase nonetheless.</p>



<p>So, Knight&#8217;s Vow is definitely one of the best support items in League of Legends!</p>

<h2><strong>5. Redemption</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="439" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-redemption-1024x439.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13481" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-redemption-1024x439.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-redemption-300x129.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-redemption-768x329.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-redemption-1536x658.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-redemption-150x64.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-redemption-750x321.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-redemption-1140x488.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-supp-items-redemption.jpg 1634w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>And lastly, we have <strong>Redemption</strong>. In theory, this should really be the best support item in LoL! However, Redemption never really got the popularity we all hoped it would get. I&#8217;m not sure whether it&#8217;s the range or the cooldown it has, but it&#8217;s definitely not what it could be.</p>



<p>Now, Redemption has pretty useful stats too. It grants you +15 ability haste, +200 health, +100% base mana regeneration, and +20% heal and shield power. You could argue that the item should only be purchased on enchanter supports, but that&#8217;s not true. <strong>Morgana, Leona, </strong>and <strong>Braum</strong> can all find good uses for Redemption.</p>



<p>Redemption&#8217;s active is pretty simple &#8211; it creates a circle in a target area that heals allies and damages enemies. This circle can be activated from a long distance, but it can also be used while you&#8217;re dead! You can sometimes outplay your opponents by healing your allies while you&#8217;re dead. And Redemption is by far the only item in LoL that you can like this!</p>



<p>So, when should you build Redemption? Obviously, Redemption is a great choice whenever you play a healer support, and you need a bit of help with AoE healing. Because of that, <strong>Soraka, Seraphine, Lulu, </strong>and<strong> Janna</strong> are all great choices.</p>



<p>However, you can purchase Redemption on anybody and make it work. It&#8217;s a situational item that works great if you can time it right.</p>



<p>Those are the top 5 best support items in League of Legends!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Master Yi is one of those champions that, if he really gets fed early, he will simply run down every lane and slaughter everyone on your team. If not, he can focus on power farming. You won’t see him gank any lane, but when he completes his core items, the same thing will happen he will simply end the game by always killing everyone on your team. Master Yi is a champion that has really high physical damage output, but he is not invincible. Despite having incredible damage, Master Yi lacks CC to stop his enemies. His only sustainability is his W which can be easily stopped with a stun or taunt or even silence.</p>



<p>Master Yi relies on his basic attacks and always needs to get near a champion to damage them. He has one gap closer, which is his alpha strike which is his main damage source. Master Yi can be daunting on lower ranks. Still, in <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/which-ranks-are-considered-as-high-elo-ones-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher elo</a>, he really doesn’t get played that often because people know how to easily counter him. Now that we’ve seen how e fairs in games, let’s study his skills so you can counter him even further.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Master Yi’s Abilities&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<ul><li><strong>Passive – Double Strike – </strong>Each time master Yi strikes an opponent, he gains one stack of Double strikes. At 3 stacks, he strikes twice, the second strike being 50% weaker than the first one. This ability can critically strike a tower on the 2<sup>nd</sup> hit.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Q –</strong> <strong>Alpha Strike – </strong>Master Yi vanishes and goes on alpha strike to damage 4 nearby enemies. He cannot be targeted; after a certain period, he reemerges and inflicts physical damage to enemies. Master Yi can use this ability to render certain skillshots useless or dodge a tower strike or any other damage when cast at the right time. This skill can also serve as a blink ability as Master Yi reemerges in front of his target.</li><li><strong>W –</strong> <strong>Meditate – </strong>Master Yi stops all of his actions to meditate. While meditating, he regenerates his health with a strength depending on how much health he is missing. He also gains damage reduction while meditating, and he can generate a stack of double strikes each second.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>E –</strong> <strong>Wuju Style – </strong>Master Yi can activate this skill to enhance his basic attacks making him deal true damage for each basic attack.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>R –</strong> <strong>Highlander – </strong>This ability gives Master Yi tremendous amounts of attack and movement speed when used. He also gains immunity to slows and cripples; if ever he is under the influence of slows, he can cast this skill to cleanse himself of all slows. This ability also provides a passive skill. Whenever Master Yi performs a takedown, he reduces all non-ultimate ability’s cooldown by 70%. This Is his initiating ability which also gives him Ghosting. This passive allows him to pass by units without obstruction.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Now you have the basic knowledge of how Master Yi works. Let’s look at the champions that counter him or team compositions that can shut him down completely.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Best Champions to Counter Master Yi in Season 11</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Tryndamere</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13473" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-tryndamere.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Tryndamere is a champion that functions almost the same as Master Yi; he relies on basic attacks to take down enemies, a gap closer ability that also has damage, and a heal to sustain himself. They are pretty much the same, but the counter comes from his Ultimate skill. Tryndamere can trade hits with Master YI; as they both reach critical levels of HP, he gains the upper hand because his damage gets higher the lower his health is. He can cast his ultimate, which makes him immune to death for a few seconds. He also can out damage Master Yi because of his W ability which reduces the enemy’s physical damage output.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>2. Jax</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13472" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-jax.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>With Jax, countering Master Yi is pretty simple. Let Master Yi cast his Alpha Strike on you. When he reemerges, cast your counter strike to render all his basic attacks useless; you can recast this ability to stun him. If ever Master Yi tries to get away from your E stun, you have a Q gap closer and chase him. It is also easy to beat Master Yi’s damage with Jax, a very strong late-game champion. Jax can also be used as a jungle champion that can easily counter jungle Master Yi and harass him in his own jungle camps.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Fiddlesticks</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-13471" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-master-yi-counters-fiddlesticks.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>You can counter Master Yi with this champion as a jungler or even as a support. Master Yi’s weakness is when he can’t get near the enemy ADC or mages, which Fiddle can abuse. He has a fear ability that sends champions running away from Fiddle. Thanks to this ability, ADC’s and Mages can do their job to burst down Master Yi and basically win the entire game. Suppose you have the ability to <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-peel-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peel</a> Master Yi away from your enemies. In that case, he basically becomes useless throughout the game.</p>



<h2><strong>The Best Items For Countering Master Yi</strong></h2>



<p><strong><em>Everfrost</em></strong><em> – </em>this item can lock him down in one location, and mage champions can then burst him down or cast more crowd control abilities because CC’s are the main counter for Master Yi.</p>



<p><strong><em>Frozen Heart</em></strong><em> </em>– This item is very important to tank champions when facing against a Yi because of its passive that greatly reduces physical damage from enemy champions. With Master Yi being a champion that greatly relies on basic attacks, tanks can mitigate Yi’s great damage output.</p>



<p><strong><em>Zhonya’s Hourglass</em></strong><em> </em>– With this item, a champion can go into stasis which makes them invulnerable. This is great as it stalls Master Yi from bursting you down, and if he can’t perform, a takedown he won’t be able to reset his cooldowns. This item also provides the user a flat amount of armor which is always great against champions that deal physical damage.</p>

<h2><strong>How To Play Against Master Yi? The Best Tips:</strong></h2>



<p>Master Yi can be really easy to counter, just pick champions that have stuns or roots, and you’re good to go. But one <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC </a>ability<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a>is not enough to stop him from snowballing or killing your entire team in teamfights. A stun is Master Yi’s greatest weakness because he is a squishy champion. This glass cannon constantly needs peeling from his tanks or supports. Be careful in teamfights; you need to spot where Master Yi is because he comes into the fight after everyone has used their stuns, so reserve your <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC abilities</a> for him just in case he comes in late. </p>



<p>You can also harass him early game so that he doesn’t get to build his core items early and doesn’t snowball out of control. Assassins also work great against Master Yi like Shaco. With all this in mind, now you know that all it takes to defeat Master Yi is to lock him down with stuns or roots or basically kill him fast so that he doesn’t get the chance to kill you. Picking tank champions against him is not a robust counter because of his true damage ability that comes from his E ability, Wuju Style.</p>



<p> Now you know how to counter Master Yi, especially he has a high pick rate in lower elos. Go out there and win more games, GLHF summoner; see you on the rift.</p>

<p>League of Legends is a game that requires procuring a vast pool of information and staying up to date at all times. If you’ve got the knowledge advantage over your opponent, the chances are that you’ll win more often than not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing what items are currently the most purchased and viable and which Champion performs the best in each role will give you insight that will keep you dominant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>League is an ever-changing game. With each patch, something new comes up, whether a new meta or a small update to the existing one. There are not many ways to accurately track these statistics within the game itself – and that’s where websites come in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>League of Legends statistics websites are some of the most useful pieces of the internet that you can ever have the chance of visiting. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned player, there’s always something valuable within these websites that will improve your understanding of the game’s current state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though there are many, I’ve compiled the <strong>5 Best Statistics Websites for League of Legends,</strong> and I hope that they will help you understand the game and improve your skills further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, let us begin with our list.&nbsp; (Disclaimer: Most of these sites offer similar services. They are listed in no particular order, and it’s only a matter of preference when choosing which to use.)</p>



<h2><strong>1. OP.GG</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="471" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-league-of-legends-websites-1024x471.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14573" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-league-of-legends-websites-1024x471.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-league-of-legends-websites-300x138.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-league-of-legends-websites-768x353.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-league-of-legends-websites-1536x706.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-league-of-legends-websites-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-league-of-legends-websites-150x69.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-league-of-legends-websites-750x345.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-league-of-legends-websites-1140x524.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://op.gg" target="_blank">OP.GG</a><a href="http://op.gg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a>is a website that I frequent the most whenever I’m tracking my progress through the ranks. It is incredibly simple to use, with a straightforward UI and design that suits every purpose. </p>



<p>Using this site, you can look up any Summoner out there on every server in the game. You can browse their match history, check out what Champions they play the most, and even take a gander at their previous seasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This option to check out what someone played in their past seasons gives this site a nostalgia-exploring status. I love getting on from time to time to check out what I was doing back in seasons 2 and 3 and reminisce about the good old days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Op.gg also gives the option of tracking live games, evaluating your impact in a game, and some other cool statistic goodies that are very detailed and useful to review. As the site I visit most, I also like it the most. But you may disagree.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>2. Leagueofgraphs.com</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="470" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-league-1024x470.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14574" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-league-1024x470.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-league-300x138.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-league-768x353.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-league-1536x705.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-league-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-league-150x69.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-league-750x344.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-league-1140x524.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><a href="http://leagueofgraphs.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leagueofgraphs</a> is <em>detailed</em>. And I mean it. Everything you can think of is there, and it is especially infamous for providing excellent information on your recent games. </p>



<p>It is an amazing site that will give you insight into what you might be doing wrong, which areas of your game you should improve, and other amazing goodies. It also features one of the best Champion mastery trackers, which can help you see who’s the best at each Champion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from being amazing at providing you an in-depth look at how well you play, how your matches are structured, and just about everything related to your gameplay – it also gives you a lot of other things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These include matchups, runes, builds, stats, and just about everything you can think of. I highly recommend this site – it’s fun to use, easy to navigate, and amazingly helpful in more ways than one.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. U.GG</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="469" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-league-1024x469.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14577" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-league-1024x469.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-league-300x137.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-league-768x352.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-league-1536x703.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-league-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-league-150x69.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-league-750x343.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-league-1140x522.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://u.gg" target="_blank">U.G</a><a href="http://u.gg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G</a> is the go-to website for checking out what’s currently in the meta. Everyone’s favorite site has a great tier list of the best picks in the current patch, their win rates, and other stats surrounding them.</p>



<p>I use u.gg a lot when I go into a full try-hard gaming session to get the most out of my games with viable and strong picks. I’ve also utilized the amazing tier list for several of my lists on this very website, as it is incredibly detailed, full of information, and helpful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But it doesn’t do only that. Like op.gg, it allows for tracking live games, has a multi-search feature for looking up multiple people at once, etc. It’s an amazing website that’s about as simple as its name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I highly recommend adding this site to your daily League of Legends routine, as you never know when the meta will decide to shift.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Blitz.GG</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="470" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-lol-1024x470.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14578" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-lol-1024x470.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-lol-300x138.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-lol-768x352.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-lol-1536x704.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-lol-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-lol-150x69.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-lol-750x344.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-websites-for-lol-1140x523.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The website is once known as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://champion.gg" target="_blank">Champion.gg</a> (which is still up but outdated) is almost identical to Leagueofgraphs and U.GG. </p>



<p>It offers a Champion tier list that’s frequently updated, various statistics, synergies, who’s the best for combat, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s really not much else to be said, as it shares all of its features with the websites I’ve already covered on the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was bound to happen, as it is an oversaturated market. Despite that, it’s still a great site and even offers an app if that’s your sort of thing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>5. Lolalytics.com </strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="469" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-lol-1024x469.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14575" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-lol-1024x469.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-lol-300x137.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-lol-768x352.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-lol-1536x704.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-lol-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-lol-150x69.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-lol-750x344.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-sites-for-lol-1140x522.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p><a href="http://lolalytics.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lolalytics</a> is, once again, basically the same as the previous ones. It offers your usual Champion tier list and a breakdown of the recent patch notes, changes, and updates to Champions. </p>



<p>You also get to check out a global leaderboard of the best players, study their games and picks, as well as some pro builds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from providing a normal tier list for regular games, the site is unique because it even gives you an ARAM and One for All tier list. This is amazing for people that love to run ARAM often, and there’s a lot of those, myself included.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lolalytics also provides valuable information on Champion counters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The site has its own Discord server, a friendly community that can help you with anything you might be confused about. There are not many members, but I’m sure you’ll fit in just fine.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Following the statistics tends to get tedious. But, unfortunately, or not, it is incredibly important and a core part of every player’s path of improvement. If you want to get better at the game, knowing what’s best at the moment and other stats relating to performances, viabilities, etc., is pivotal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowledge is key in League of Legends, and these websites are there to provide you with just that. I highly recommend them, as they all offer something unique but remain largely the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These lists take time and effort to make, so leave feedback to help us improve them. Keep a keen eye out on our website for more League of Legends-related content such as lists, guides, and articles.&nbsp;</p>
