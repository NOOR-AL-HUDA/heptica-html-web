<p>Their iconic red and blue kit adorned the cover of eFootball PES for many years, and they entered teams in tournaments on the platform. It gave the title, and developers Konami, further reach than they would otherwise hope to achieve. Now,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/league-of-legends/fc-barcelona-enter-league-of-legends-esports-superliga-1684952/">Dexerto</a>&nbsp;reports the club is reaching into the world of League of Legends.<br><br>It doesn’t seem like an obvious fit, but Barcelona is more than just a football club; they take their eSports seriously as well. League of Legends is one of the most popular eSports globally, with a reported $2.24m prize fund for the World Championship,&nbsp;<a href="https://sports.bwin.com/en/news/other-sports/e-sports/esports-2021/">according to a Bwin eSports infographic</a>. It makes sense from a branding perspective for the club to choose LoL for their next eSports venture.<br><br>They have recently purchased the spot of S2V Sports in LoL’s Superliga for 2022 and reportedly beat fellow La Liga side Sevilla to the slot. It’s a huge move for the club and their biggest single step into eSports. As well as competing in Konami’s eFootball, they have also competed in Heartstone and Rockey League with varying success. Their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/barcelona-espbarcelona/story/4486577/barcelona-financial-crisis-laid-bare-as-laliga-cut-300m-from-spending-cap">current financial situation</a>&nbsp;is precarious, but that hasn’t stopped their eSports expansion. Perhaps the club feels that their involvement with eSports can help reveal additional markets for them to explore. Expect to see plenty of Blaugrana shirts in front of screens next year.<br><br>The move does throw up an interesting rivalry that LoL won’t have seen the like of before. Gerard Pique is a Barcelona legend, having spent 13 years of his career at Camp Nou. He’s a global superstar, married to pop star Shakira with almost every major international honour to his name. Interestingly, he won’t be winning things with Barcelona in LoL, quite the opposite. He’s scheduled to go up against them after securing his spot in Superliga.<br><br>He has formed an as-yet-unnamed team with streamer Ibai Llanos, and have bought their own slot in the league, formerly occupied by&nbsp;<a href="https://liquipedia.net/leagueoflegends/Astralis">Astralis</a>. They’ve already begun recruiting for their venture, as AD carry Rafa ‘Rafitta’ Zapata and&nbsp;<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/most-fun-junglers/">jungler</a>&nbsp;Luis ‘Koldo’ Pérez have already agreed to sign for them, with more additions expected before the December 15 full announcement. What is known is that they’ll be led by head coach Jesús ‘Falco’ Pérez Rubio and assistant coach Tiago ‘Aziado’ Rodrigues. For Pique’s sake, we hope they have a better relationship than former FC Barcelona head coach Ronald Koeman and club president Joan Laporte!<br><br>Whilst the cost of Barcelona’s deal has not been revealed, Pique and Llanos paid €300,000 (kn 2.2m) for their spot in September. Llanos is a renowned streamer who has always spoken of his desire to own a LoL team, whilst Pique’s wider appeal will help develop a reach outside of the usual LoL spectrum.<br><br>It certainly makes for an interesting Superliga next year and one that even non-LoL players and fans might find fascinating. If it draws more viewers and interest to the game, it can only be a good thing.</p>

<p>For people who hate to visit a traditional brick-and-mortar shop to buy video games, there is no better platform than an online website where you can easily download the best video games for your PC within the comfort of your home.</p>



<p>Although the market is often led by a single industry leader, many alternatives are considerably better. They offer an easy-to-download facility for their users and ensure that the process is thorough and easy to understand for all demographics.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll go through a list of the best online alternatives to satisfy your gaming needs and help you get good deals.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="500" height="333" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-14867" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image.png 500w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-300x200.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image-150x100.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Types of Video Games</strong></h2>



<p>Video games are categorized differently according to their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/importance-goals-design-gamification-games-karl-kapp/">objectives</a>, themes, and characteristics. There are numerous mechanisms through which developers structure their games. These games are further divided into their sub-genres. Each genre is designed to appeal to the taste of different users. The games are divided into the following genres:</p>



<ul><li>Action games,</li><li>Action-adventure games,</li><li>Adventure games,</li><li>Idle games,</li><li>Puzzle games</li><li>Role-playing games,</li><li>Simulation games,</li><li>Sports games,</li><li>Strategy games.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Alternative Ways to Download Video Games</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. GOG.com (Good Old Games) </strong></h3>



<p>GOG was previously known as Good Old Games. It is a subsidiary of CD Projekt managed by the developers of the popular Witcher series. You can find the best and improvised DRM-free standard computer games, indie games, and other famous computer games at the most affordable prices.</p>



<p>They also allow their users to link their other accounts. Furthermore, you can even compare games from other compatible stores like Epic Games Store, Steam, and even PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Uplay</strong></h3>



<p>Uplay is a digital store of the well-known video gaming company, Ubisoft. Unlike other platforms, Uplay provides a communication channel for its users to interact and chat with their friends online, making their gaming experience more fascinating.</p>



<p>It benefits its users with promotions and deals every Wednesday. After completing challenges you can even get hold of 20% Club discounts for your next purchases or you can subscribe to Uplay + for other benefits.</p>



<h3><strong>3. GMG-Green Man Gaming</strong></h3>



<p>GMG offers its customers the same design as its equivalents. Their website has expanded their catalog including the list of PC and Mac titles. The site offers users the best titles with standard sales prices. It’s important that you find yourself a site that is reliable and consistently provides updates and reviews, and the one that also allows you to <a href="https://install-game.com">download game pc free</a> of cost on their website. With a bit of research, you’ll be able to find the perfect site that has the games you love, whether it’s free of charge or at discounted rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What should matter for you is the security and quality of the download and gameplay. If you wish to take advantage of discounts, you can get hold of them by signing up for their loyalty program known as XP. Here you can earn rewards and XP after making purchases. Later you can even jump to different levels, namely, Gold, Bronze, Silver, where you can get the privilege of free purchases and discounts.</p>



<h3><strong>4.  Humble Store</strong></h3>



<p>Best known for its collection of games following a set theme and offering discounts, Humble Store facilitates its users with Humble Bundles where you can download software, eBooks, royalty-free music along your desired games.</p>



<h3><strong>5. Itch.io</strong></h3>



<p>Itch.io is a great alternative to Steam that provides a plethora of indie titles and other games free of cost. It supersedes the mainstream gaming channels that like hogging the limelight by offering developers the ‘’pay what you want’’ model. Now developers can customize the theme of their page and set their price starting from $0 and upload their games.</p>



<h3><strong>6. Epic Games Store</strong></h3>



<p>Epic Games Store is the newest substitute for Steam in the online marketplace. Until now it has offered its audiences an array of free titles, exclusive deals, and affordable games. The creator of Fortnite also allows an 88% revenue-sharing scheme for developers. However, you might incur some browsing errors and privacy issues.</p>



<h2><strong>The Benefits of Video Games</strong></h2>



<p>Video games often carry the negative connotation of laziness. A person who plays games more often needs to be more than a couch potato. Although most people consider gaming to only consist of bad outcomes, you might not know that playing a video game helps sharpen a person’s mind by teaching them new skills and ways to escape puzzling situations.</p>

<p>Besides entertaining users, games are a great source for learning, strategic thinking, and <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/9-ways-to-dramatically-improve-your-creativity.html">creativity</a>. It empowers a person to have effective communications and explore and expand their mental capacities by letting them solve problems productively. The ability to assess and identify possible risks and rewards helps gamers to utilize these strengths in their careers.</p>



<p>Digital video games act as an escape for individuals who want to spend some time away from their hectic routines. Formerly, Steam was the only gaming service to provide the gamic experience and attend to the needs of avid gamers. Now many competitors have emerged in the online marketplace proving their worth by offering their customers better deals at affordable prices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VPN is one of the most popular services in our modern-day world. But playing League of Legends with VPN is one of those topics people are very conflicted about. There are some positive and some negative sides to it. And in this post, we’ll talk about all of them!</p>



<p>But before we do so, know that the idea of playing League of Legends with VPN isn’t a new one. People had always tried to make it work, even when the game was still young. First, because they wanted to keep their privacy and separate their LoL accounts from their real-life personalities. And second, for some people, VPN is the only way to actually access League!</p>



<p><strong><em>How is that possible?</em></strong></p>



<p>Well, let’s first understand what exactly VPN is how it operates. Then we’ll explore why you should or shouldn’t play League of Legends with a VPN service on!</p>



<h2><strong>What is VPN?</strong></h2>



<p>VPN stands for <strong>virtual private network, </strong>and its only goal is to give you<strong> privacy and anonymity while being on the internet.</strong> </p>



<h2><strong><em>How do the VPN companies do this?</em></strong></h2>



<p>Well, they do it by disguising your actual IP address and hiding it from the internet. So when you search the internet or play games online, the VPN company sends that data from their base rather than your own IP. That’s why through VPN, you can acquire a different IP every time you log in on the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, all the searches and all the traffic that you do while you have a VPN on is transformed into an unreadable code by the VPN service. This way, no one can actually see what you’re doing on the internet and who’s doing all those searches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And for gamers, this may sound ideal! Being able to connect to everyone on the internet and play League of Legends with them while your identity is secured seems like the dream, doesn’t it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, using a VPN for gaming does have some major implications for the safety of your accounts!</p>



<p>So let’s talk about those implications!</p>



<p><strong>Also read: <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/lethality-league-of-legends-how-does-it-work-updated/" data-type="post" data-id="7321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is Lethality in LoL and How Does it Work?</a></strong></p>



<h2><strong>Can You Play League of Legends with VPN?</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12529" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Short answer &#8211; yes! You can totally play League of Legends with any VPN service, no matter whether it’s free or premium. Changing your IP address and hiding your current location doesn’t necessarily stop you from login into your LoL account, but it may hurt you in the long run!</p>



<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>



<p>If you haven’t noticed, Riot Games have been really dedicated to making their users (us, the players) as secure as possible lately. They’ve introduced free account name and password changes, but also email confirmations. And you simply must confirm that you’re the owner of the account by identifying yourself to Riot.</p>



<p>The reason why this is important is that the VPN services do the complete opposite to this!</p>



<h3><strong>So, where’s the conflict?</strong></h3>



<p>The real problem of playing League of Legends with VPN is that it changes your IP address &#8211; the same IP address that Riot Games identify you with in their data. So when you log in from a completely new location with the same account, Riot detects that as a possible hacking/selling/sharing that account!</p>



<p>If you log in three or four times to LoL in one day, each time using a different IP address, chances are that Riot will notice that. And they might be forced to put a stop to that account because, to them, it seems sketchy.</p>



<p>So should you or should you not use a VPN for playing League of Legends?</p>



<p><strong>Also read: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/demotion-shield-expiring-updated-2020-heres-what-it-means/" data-type="post" data-id="7297" target="_blank">What is Demotion Shield Expiring</a></strong></p>



<h2><strong>Should You Play League of Legends with VPN?</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="573" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-1024x573.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12528" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-1024x573.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-300x168.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-768x430.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-1536x860.jpeg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-750x420.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-1140x638.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn.jpeg 1909w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>In my opinion &#8211; no! The risk of getting your account banned is simply not worth it. And if your only reason for wanting to play LoL with VPN is just to secure yourself, my advice is to not even try it! You can use your VPN service for everything else you do on the internet, but you should disable it for logging into League.</p>



<p><strong><em>However, what if you can’t actually play League of Legends without a VPN?</em></strong></p>



<p>For some people, not having a VPN service is an issue for playing League. That’s because their own internet providers have pre-determined settings that block many potentially harmful sites and applications. And some of them detect League of Legends and other games as such.</p>



<p>But even though there are things you can do to unblock League of Legends and remove it from that list, VPN also solves that problem for you. It removes all those regulations that your internet provider might have for safety or otherwise. And the VPN lets you login into LoL and play!</p>



<p><strong>However, the same risks that we explained above remain!</strong></p>



<p>I’ve actually talked to many people who have been playing League of Legends with VPN successfully for years. They’ve never had an issue with banning or otherwise. However, you never know what might happen to you specifically. You might have the best of luck while using the VPN service, and you might have none. So the choice is only yours to make!</p>



<p>In the end, make sure to contact the Riot Games support service and explain your situation to them. They often try whatever they can to solve these kinds of problems!</p>

<p>Have you ever watched or read a guide for your favorite League of Legends champion? And after the guide, you felt confident in yourself and jumped into a ranked game… only to realize that your match is completely different than what the guide said. If yes, then it’s time to meet Zar.gg!</p>



<p>But don’t worry! I’ve been in that same situation myself hundreds of times before, especially when I was still learning LoL. It’s tough to know everything that could happen with each champion in the match. And it’s challenging to actually decide the best possible outcome every time you get out of the base!</p>



<p>So how do you <em>actually use</em> the knowledge that you have for LoL? How do we maximize the potential of each tip given to us by a professional player?</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://zar.gg" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zar.gg&nbsp;</a>is a player-friendly software that accompanies you while you’re playing League of Legends. It has a library of tips, tricks, builds, rune recommendations, and all other helpful advice. Zar.gg gives you all this information in the form of minimalistic and “out of the way” pop-up windows while you’re in the game.</p>



<p><strong><em>So how does this work in reality?</em></strong></p>



<p>Let’s say that you’re playing Katarina versus Annie in the mid lane. When Annie spends her passive stacks and has no stun for at least a few seconds, Zar.gg will give you a tip that it’s time for you to jump and trade. And when Annie has her stun available, it will tell you to be careful and not fight.</p>



<p>Although this is a simple example, Zar.gg works the same way for any champion matchup. The software always finds helpful information that you can actually use in your game and not just have the knowledge.</p>



<p>But champion matchups aren’t the only thing that Zar.gg helps you with. So let’s check how the whole app works!</p>



<h2><strong>How Does Zar.GG Help You?</strong></h2>



<p>Zar.gg does a couple of things that improve your gameplay and increase the odds of you winning. Here are the main features!</p>



<h3><strong>In-Game Tips</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="575" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-1024x575.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12486" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-1024x575.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-300x168.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-768x431.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-750x421.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-1140x640.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips.jpeg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The in-game tips are a core feature of Zar.gg. But as I mentioned, these tips aren’t all about how to deal with your lane opponents. Instead, there are tips for everything!</p>



<p>For example, you may be playing Kha’Zix jungle. Well, Zar.gg will display appropriate information based on the champions you have on your team and the champions you’re facing against. It will tell you which lanes are the best for ganking, where you should focus, and whether it’s even worth ganking a lane!</p>



<p>Following these tips&nbsp;<em>significantly lowers</em>&nbsp;the number of mistakes you make per game. And the best part about them is that they appear in small windows. They don’t clutter your screen, and they don’t get in the way!</p>



<h3><strong>Live Dashboard</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12487" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-1024x576.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-300x169.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-768x432.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-750x422.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-1140x642.png 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Live Dashboard feature appears when you press “Tab” while in the game. Normally, you only see the score table. But with Zar.gg, you also see tons of other useful information and statistics, such as:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Item recommendation &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>tell you which items will increase your power the most at any point in the game.</li><li><strong>Warding &#8211;</strong>&nbsp;informs you about the best ward spots based on your role, champion, AND current position.</li><li><strong>Other players &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>shows you which players have acquired the most amount of gold, who’s got the most items, and who’s carrying.</li><li><strong>Overall performance &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>displays info about CS/min and Vision/min about each player in the game.</li></ul>



<p>The Live Dashboard helps you understand the players in your game more and make better decisions around it.</p>



<h3><strong>Draft Advice</strong></h3>



<p>Even in champion select, Zar.gg has your back! And it’s probably one of the best features that a League software might have!</p>



<p>What does it do?</p>



<p>It gives you advice on which champion to pick, based on your history and personal playstyle. It scans the enemy team and provides you helpful information about which champion could counter them. But it also gives you statistics so you can check what your actual chance of beating that team with your champion is.</p>



<p>You can also import runes from high elo players without the need to manually set them. And you can also check the power spikes for both teams, so you know what to expect from each champion once you get into the game!</p>

<h2><strong>Why Is Zar.gg Here?</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12490" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-300x169.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-768x432.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-750x422.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg.jpeg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Well, to help you!</p>



<p>The idea behind Zar.gg is to enable you to use all the knowledge about League of Legends available on the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>High elo players have created guides that you can download on the Zar.gg anytime and load them into your games. You can try multiple different guides per champion, so you can find the one that fits your playstyle. But you can also create helpful guides yourself and publish them for other plates to use!</p>



<p><strong>Zar.gg is a tool created by League players for League players!&nbsp;</strong>It takes everything into consideration about the average LoL player and tries to help actively in the game.</p>



<p>I personally love using the software and find it extremely useful, even though I’m a Master player. It’s awesome because it reminds me of the things I should be doing in every game!</p>

<p>League of Legends is one of the most popular games among the students from all over the world. But what’s the secret of its popularity? Let’s try to find it out!</p>



<p>First of all, League of Legends has a competitive nature. Since you are supposed to <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-quickly-climb-the-league-of-legends-rank-ladder/" data-type="post" data-id="8671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">climb that ranked ladder</a>, it may feel like you’re reaching high achievements and perform better than others. Besides, if you keep going to the high level, you might be allowed to play against the professional players. Sounds quite exciting, doesn’t it?</p>



<p>As a student, you probably lack opportunities to have fun with your friends. However, you can spend time with peers while playing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2020/10/30/how-riot-games-built-the-league-of-legends-world-championship-during-a-pandemic/">League of Legends</a>. This game gives you a great chance to create your own team and enjoy your free nights together with friends. What’s more, LoL makes it easy to make new acquaintances. So maybe you’ll meet nice pals while playing?</p>



<p>The next reason why a lot of people love League of Legends is its regular updates. Riot is working very hard to ensure that players have a great time, so that’s why they are constantly throwing out new versions of the game. Hence, it’s impossible to get bored with LoL, even if you are an old player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that you realize why League of Legends is a great way to entertain yourself, you are probably wondering how to play it without compromising your learning. Below, you can find some effective recommendations for that.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>1. Complete your homework first</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="675" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-lol-1024x675.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12305" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-lol-1024x675.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-lol-300x198.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-lol-768x506.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-lol-750x494.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-lol-1140x751.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-lol.jpg 1244w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>According to some research, student gamers spend nearly 30% less time reading. They also devote 34% less time to their home assignments. As a result, their academic performance gets worse. Hence, it’s important for young people to set up tight academic routines, where they play games only after completing all the necessary work. However, sometimes tasks may be too challenging to complete on your own. If you find your homework extremely complicated, you can <a href="https://essayontime.com.au/case-study-writing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">find case study writing service</a> or turn to an essay platform, where professional writers will help you with papers in any discipline. Anyway, no matter whether you work on your assignments on your own or ask for help, the most important thing is that everything must be finished before you start playing League of Legends. </p>



<h2><strong>2. Set a time limit </strong></h2>



<p>It’s so easy to get absolutely absorbed with League of Legends and lose track of time. The game is so exciting that it makes you forget about everything, especially your studies. But you have some school responsibilities that must be fulfilled and it’s essential to take them into account while planning your day. To manage your time effectively, set a timetable where you have all the necessary things scheduled. This way you will ensure that you don’t miss your deadlines. Also, bear in mind that you might underestimate the time needed to complete your tasks, so add a few buffer hours for learning.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Don’t play late at night </strong></h2>



<p>Adolescents often play video games all night long. Some studies show that approximately 24% of students love gaming after 9 pm. However, this behavior is quite destructive as it causes insomnia and harms mental health. Psychologists say that people that have poor sleep habits struggle with daytime sleepiness and fatigue. Their memory, concentration, and other cognitive functions get significantly worse after playing League of Legends at night. And of course, it affects their learning outcomes in a very negative way. Therefore, you should find the right time for gaming if you don’t want your grades to become lower. It would be better to spend a few hours in front of the screen before or in between your classes. This way, you can keep your productivity levels high. </p>

<h2><strong>4. Don’t spend too much time alone</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="677" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-league-1024x677.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12304" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-league-1024x677.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-league-300x198.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-league-768x508.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-league-750x496.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-league-1140x754.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-tips-for-students-playing-league.jpg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Gaming sometimes makes students socially <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/issues/isolation?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_28f1dfcfb077f4537776a7b70dc5414f99f5f929-1628250970-0-gqNtZGzNAuKjcnBszQeO" target="_blank">isolated</a>. Adolescents become unwilling to get involved in social interaction or build social relationships because they find it not so exciting as living in a virtual world. In its turn, this may lead to anxiety and depression. Such mental states inevitably influence cognitive functioning and academic performance. The study is impossible without regular social contacts, so gamers may lack guidance and companionship. To avoid difficulties with learning, you should spend more time in the company of peers that share your academic goals and interests. </p>

<h2><strong>5. Get professional help</strong></h2>



<p>Of course, it’s nice to deal with all the homework on your own. But is this actually possible? If you want to have enough time for your leisure activities, you might need help. Asking some experts for assistance with your home assignments may save you from severe stress. What’s more, it can boost your grades and increase your general student rating. In contrast to a popular belief, there is nothing wrong with asking someone to write an essay or research paper for you. In fact, this strategy can make your life more balanced and exciting. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Riot Games is responsible for one of the biggest online multiplayer games in the world – <em>League of Legends</em>. But it&#8217;s not just that; it&#8217;s also behind the <em>League of Legends</em> eSports competitions, running the game and tournaments hand in hand<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/did-you-know-total-league-of-legends-player-count-updated/" data-type="post" data-id="6960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">, gaining more popularity year on year</a>. And now it&#8217;s set to grow even further as the company announced that it&#8217;s going to be opening a brand-new studio in Shanghai, China.</p>



<h2><strong>The Rise of Riot Games</strong></h2>



<p>In 2006, Riot Games was created by two university friends who had a common love for video games and a passion for creating a game with longevity. Disillusioned by developers that release game after game, they believed games worked best if they were released for free and <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/5-ways-riot-can-improve-high-elo-solo-queue/">had updates, patches</a>, perks, levels, and much more that came at a later date.</p>



<p>It was something that would give the game longevity and inspire a loyal fan base. And in 2009, along came <em>League of Legends</em>, a free-to-play game that is now known by millions across the globe. It&#8217;s become a game that listens to its players, becoming more of a gaming community rather than something you&#8217;d just sit down and play.</p>



<p>Often, gaming developers would listen to players and note their feedback to incorporate it into the next release. As the company grew and expanded its offices across the world, the game&#8217;s popularity grew as well. Not just with people playing, but with people watching, and this saw Riot Games move into the eSports arena, holding its own tournaments and championships. Now, with a move into the Far East, things are going to get even better.</p>

<h2><strong>Reaching Out to China</strong></h2>



<p>Okay, so for those of us who keep up to date with what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes, we already know that Tencent, a Chinese gaming giant, owns riot Games. And yes, there are those of us who might question how much influence Chinese companies have on Riot Games. But there&#8217;s been a lot of reassurance that Tencent acts as the publisher, letting Riot Games operate on its own.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t anything to be concerned about because when you look at how long Tencent has been in control (since 2011), they&#8217;ve let Riot Games continue as they have. All this means is that it will be easier to expand into the Chinese market and leverage the opportunities there – provided the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/tencent-plummets-as-chinese-crackdown-fears-persist">Chinese Government allows it</a>. Opportunities for employees and for gamers alike!</p>



<p>The new studio is set to open in Shanghai, focusing on creating new games for players on a global scale. It&#8217;ll also be good for the economy, with hundreds of roles being made available for games developers and designers in China. It&#8217;s also a good time for this move to happen as PC gaming is hugely popular in China, making more than 32% of game revenue and accounts for almost 45% of gamers. With so many passionate players in China enjoying <em>League of Legends</em>, and the continued growth of <em>League of Legends</em> eSports, it&#8217;s exciting times ahead.</p>



<h2><strong>What can we expect?</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="941" height="529" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/riot-games-building-chinese-studio.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12226" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/riot-games-building-chinese-studio.jpg 941w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/riot-games-building-chinese-studio-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/riot-games-building-chinese-studio-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/riot-games-building-chinese-studio-750x422.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px" /></figure></div>



<p>Of course, we can expect new content for <em>League of Legends</em>, and with more people working on it, we can probably expect it sooner too. But we&#8217;ll also see a massive contribution to the eSports side of things. Riot Games is already responsible for one of the biggest eSports leagues globally, including the League of Legends Championship Series and the World Championship.</p>



<p>Over the years, it&#8217;s become a commercial success, with people just enjoying watching the competition as opposed to playing. Of course, it&#8217;s also attracted the interest of sponsors and betting companies that love to find <a href="https://www.stsbet.co.uk/en-gb/sports/sport/esport-moba">emerging markets</a> and giving more things for fans to enjoy.</p>



<p>Now, with more opportunities on hand, we can expect a lot more. In 2020 the <em>League of Legends World Championship</em> was held in China, and again in 2021. This market is estimated to generate over $1 billion in revenue, with the majority of that sum coming from China. But as well as huge commercial opportunities, we can look forward to new games emerging from Shanghai.</p>



<p>Mobile games are popular, even more so in China, and make up the biggest portion of the gaming revenue. So now imagine <em>League of Legends</em> expanding onto mobile – more so than it has done on its <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/12-differences-between-league-of-legends-and-wild-rift/"><em>Wild Rift</em> offering</a>. Once that launches in China, as well as any new propositions, it&#8217;s going to a gaming explosion that will take the world by storm! And will there be a mobile eSports league to follow? Let&#8217;s wait and see.</p>

<p>Viewership on Twitch continues to improve every year, and in recent months the platform experienced growth rates never seen before, notably after the global COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, Twitch accounted for more than 18 billion hours watched, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 65 percent. Not even the Fortnite boom, led by Ninja in 2018, caused the same level of growth.</p>



<p>For years now, the “Just Chatting” category has dominated the content available on Twitch, especially since the pandemic started, as it offered new opportunities for personalities outside of the gaming world to put out content online. In July 2021, the category totaled more than 240 million hours watched, with an average viewership of more than 320,000 spectators.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll take a look at the most popular categories related to gameplay streaming, based on stats provided by <a href="https://escharts.com/games/july-2021">Esports Charts</a> for July, and the preeminent streamers and personalities in each one of these categories.</p>



<h2><strong>GTA V</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="569" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gta-v-1024x569.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12217" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gta-v-1024x569.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gta-v-300x167.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gta-v-768x427.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gta-v-750x417.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gta-v-1140x634.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/gta-v.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The latest entry in one of the most popular video game franchises ever, Grand Theft Auto V was released almost 8 years ago, yet, the game is still very popular, and has been the second most-watched Twitch category for the last few months, only behind “Just Chatting”. It’s important to notice that in April, the GTA V category <a href="https://dotesports.com/streaming/news/gta-v-dethrones-just-chatting-as-twitchs-most-popular-category-for-a-couple-of-weeks">surpassed “Just Chatting”</a> in total hours watched, thanks to many events related to GTA V RP, a mod that allows players to gather in one server and roleplay in the game.</p>



<p>In July, GTA streams accounted for over 140 million hours watched, with an average of 190,000 viewers and 3,151 channels. Currently, the most popular English-speaking GTA V streamers are buddha, with more than 4 million hours watched, and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ratedepicz">RatedEpicz</a>, with over 3 million. However, the leading GTA streamer in July is from Brazil, loud_coringa, who accounted for more than 12 million hours.</p>

<h2><strong>First-person shooters</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/valorant-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12221" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/valorant-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/valorant-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/valorant-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/valorant-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/valorant-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/valorant-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/valorant.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>First-person shooters are arguably the most popular video games today, and that couldn’t be different on Twitch. With titles such as Valorant and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive ranking among the most-watched Twitch categories, the genre is certainly trending in the platform.</p>



<p>The free-to-play hero shooter by Riot Games, by the way, was the fourth most-watched category in July, with 80 million hours and an average of 108,703 viewers, largely due to the many Valorant Champions Tour Challengers events that took place last month. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive didn’t achieve such expressive numbers, however, the game still accounted for almost 60 million hours watched.</p>



<p>ShahZaM was the most popular English-speaking Valorant streamer in July, with over 2,7 million hours watched, followed by Michael “<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/shroud">shroud</a>” Grzesiek, a former professional CS:GO player for Cloud9, with similar numbers.</p>



<h2><strong>Building games</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/minecraft-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12219" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/minecraft-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/minecraft-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/minecraft-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/minecraft-1536x864.jpg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/minecraft-scaled.jpg 2048w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/minecraft-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/minecraft-1140x641.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Building games like Minecraft and Roblox are still very popular among gamers of all ages, and exciting upcoming titles like <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sandbox</a>, of which developers are continuously streaming tutorials and guides, certainly helped bump the genre in streaming rankings. Combining all titles, building games totaled more than 70 million hours watched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though it was released almost 10 years ago, in November 2011, Minecraft alone accounted for 53 million hours, with an average of almost 72,000 viewers and 3,791 channels. The game is still a popular choice, especially among streamers outside the United States, with millions of hours streamed in Italian, French, Korean, and Portuguese. RanbooLive and Philza were the most-watched Minecraft streamers in July, both with almost 2 million hours watched.</p>

<h2><strong>MOBAs</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/league-of-legends-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-12218" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/league-of-legends-1024x576.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/league-of-legends-300x169.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/league-of-legends-768x432.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/league-of-legends-750x422.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/league-of-legends-1140x641.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/league-of-legends.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Led by Riot Games’ groundbreaking title League of Legends, multiplayer online battle arenas are arguably the most played video games today, selling millions of copies worldwide, and even featuring in many esports tournaments and leagues. According to Esports Charts, League of Legends and Defense of the Ancients 2 ranked among the most-watched categories on Twitch in July.</p>



<p>LoL was the third most watched category in the period, behind only “Just Chatting” and GTA V, with over 130 million hours and 180,000 spectators on average. This was largely due to several tournaments being played in July, such as the League Championship Series (LCS) and the LoL European Championship (LEC).</p>



<p>With almost 7 million hours watched in July, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/loltyler1">loltyler1</a> was the leading English-speaking LoL streamer, followed by the official channels of LEC, LCS, and LoL Champions Korea.</p>

<p>League of Legends is a very versatile game. It’s a game for solo players, for duos, for three friends playing together, or for the entire team as well. At a separate level, League of Legends is a game for the casual gamer and the competitive gamer. You often see pro-gamers with separate <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/ways-smurfing-improves-you-on-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“smurf” accounts</a> just for casual gaming every once in a while. And many a time, there are casual gamers who are looking to go Pro. There is no bar on anyone in choosing what kind of gamer you want to be with League of legends.</p>



<p>How do you transform from a casual gamer to a pro-gamer? One way is just to keep playing and getting better and better. The other way is to learn from players who are already “pro.”</p>

<h2><strong>What is Pro Guides?</strong></h2>



<p>Pro Guides is a platform for training where gamers can get training from pros in order to improve their game, usually for a small fee. The primary purpose of <a href="http://proguides.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ProGuides</a> is to help gamers upgrade their gaming skills and take them to the next level. Gamers who subscribe to ProGuides can access premium custom-designed courses for the best coaching around. By learning from and playing with the best in the game, gamers get the chance to improve their skill levels.</p>



<p>It goes without saying that ProGuides only offers tips in competitive online games. After all, it makes no sense to become “pros” at single-player games. Some of the games that Proguides offers tips for include Fortnite, League of Legends, Hearthstone, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Magic the Gathering: Arena, and Overwatch.</p>



<p>But is it really all as good as it sounds?</p>



<h2><strong>Is ProGuides good for you?</strong></h2>



<p>The answer to this question depends on the player itself. Some players may be excellent in one role in League of Legends but might need some tips from pro players while beginning to play other roles. Similarly, at times one needs help while mastering the game mechanics for a new champion, and you just don’t want to learn it by hit and trial. Why not learn from the experience of the best of the best?</p>



<h2><strong>What does ProGuides offer?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jeg_video_container jeg_video_content"><iframe title="Does &#039;Proguides&#039; Actually Work?!? --One on One with a Challenger Coach-- League of Legends" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ysnywIG2_Dk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>There are several features that Proguides offers, such as courses designed for different games, online coaching from an expert, and live coaching as you play your game. These are what you get with the Pro-membership billed at $96 annually, which isn’t too expensive. Of course, you have the free version as well. The free version offers most of the same features but in lesser quantity. With the free version, you get a taste of what you can get with going Pro. There are many videos on Youtube which you can watch for free to learn to play different games. So what makes Proguides different? The answer is that Proguides helps you scale as you get better in your game. You can climb the learning curve with help from a coach who helps at each step. This is not the case if you simply start browsing youtube or Twitch for pro-players and start learning from their gameplays.</p>

<h2><strong>Is ProGuides worth it?</strong></h2>



<p>As cool as Proguides sounds, it actually has a lot of critics. Again, it all depends on the player himself or herself. You can find many gamers who will say Proguides helped them up their game, which needs to be appreciated. At the same time, you can find people who will say they paid the annual bill for Proguides, but it didn’t really improve their ranking in the game. Could it be possible that your skill level doesn’t depend on coaching but on you yourself? Some gamers are naturally good at some of the games they play. For example, Shroud is a master in FPS games. Similarly, many other gamers are a natural talent at a particular game. How does coaching by Proguides fit in?</p>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Coaching from experts at ProGuides can help polish those rough edges that make you better at your game. These are the rough edges that you might not be aware of yourself while playing the game, and only an expert or a Pro can see the mistakes you are making but are unable to identify. That being said, if you are not genuinely interested about improving the game and are looking for a ‘shortcut’ to reaching a higher ranking, then ProGuides is probably not worth it for you.</p>

<p>It is not impossible to play video games in college, but you need to have proper time management skills. Look at here, how;</p>



<h3><strong>Create a Schedule&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Most people have improper time management skills. So, they have no idea about proper work schedule maintenance. Contrary to this, if someone sets a list of all tasks he has to finish in a day, he can easily accomplish all of them. Like this;</p>



<ul><li>2/5 study hours</li><li>1/5 for homework</li><li>1/5 playing video games</li><li>1/5 for exercise and outing</li></ul>



<p>Once you have a schedule, you can do all these while enjoying a good time for your games.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Set Importance First</strong></h3>



<p>First, you should study and then play games. For example, if there is an assignment or an essay to do you should do it first, but you can also google ‘<a href="https://essayshark.com/">write my essay</a>’ and look for a professional to help you with your homework. Then, once you complete your urgent and essential tasks, you can go further for your other schedule or play games.&nbsp;It means that you should not delay your college work. It should be your priority to avoid any misfortune in the future and develop mature nature gradually.</p>



<h3><strong>Play Something Creative</strong></h3>



<p>There are different games which are unbeatable to play during the studies. They will not lose your attention at all. Rather than that, they will enhance your focus, thinking and keep you active like&nbsp;<a href="https://bagogames.com/news-anno-2070-due-this-winter-says-ubisoft/"><strong>Anno 2070</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://bagogames.com/the-sims-4-is-an-offline-game-unlike-simcity/"><strong>Simcity</strong></a>. That&#8217;s why being a student; you should concentrate on the plan, technique, or games that help you to keep your mind engaged.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Know When to Stop&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The initial thing to learn is balancing your games and working routine, mainly being a college student, revolve around when and how to stop playing games. Sometimes you may be just wasting your time on a useless game. That&#8217;s why it is better to find something creative, either interesting or related to your studies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe you have an essay task to submit in the next week. It is better to invest this useless time to cover next week&#8217;s assignments. As soon as you know to restrict your gaming time, you can easily maintain your schedule like any expert. An effective strategy for this is to set a timer. As soon as the alarm rings, it means you have to stop playing. Don&#8217;t try to compose just for another minute. When the alarm rings, you should stop everything and go for your following schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Video games are the best entertainment source. However, numerous people find it challenging to maintain their video gameplay and studies, particularly in college. Hopefully, these tips will play an essential role in figuring out your schedule for studies and video games being present at college.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>After all, games have been around for a long time. People sometimes set interest and thirst once they play them. But, playing games permanently is addictive, and, being a student, it&#8217;s not good. Students should also concentrate on their studies. In college, students may also have good freedom and self-sufficiency. And, you can assume that since you are not at home, you can focus on playing video games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Playing games in college is not wicked. However, students should be more in control. They must have practical time management skills and self-discipline. In this way, they can easily balance gaming and their education. Moreover, here are some valuable tips that may also be helpful in this regard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been 10+ years of <a href="https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752714-LeaverBuster-FAQ">Riot Games&#8217; LeaveBuster</a> punishing people for leaving games. Should players be punished for leaving games and leaving the remaining 4 to fight an uphill battle that can waste 40 minutes of their time? Of course they should! But how does LeaveBuster determine who left, and who disconnected through their own weak will?</p>



<p>Every few months or so, there are several Reddit posts pleading for the LeaveBuster to be reworked to consider players who disconnect from their ranked games. The problem is, the LeaveBuster is a pretty straight forward mechanism that just punishes people who afk out of games. The LeaveBuster doesn&#8217;t take into account things like unintentional disconnections, bad internet connections, dropped clients, and the list goes on and on&#8230; All these factors contribute to poor quality games.</p>

<p>The problem is then passed further down the line; how does the LeaveBuster detect those players who unplugged their ethernet connection, or turned off their WiFi, and those who genuinely disconnected through no fault of their own. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s for Riot to figure out but it&#8217;s on us, the players, to ask for it. Many people aren&#8217;t aware that Riot has a support form to contact them about the LeaveBuster. However, many are also unaware that this form is often ignored and those who are told to re-submit their report may become discouraged from doing so. In the past, players submitted appeal after appeal to Riot&#8217;s support team, but they often will not respond or take action. If you wish to make your voice heard on this matter, we encourage you to fill out this form and keep submitting it until something is done.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s very possible you&#8217;re reading this because you&#8217;ve been caught by the LeaveBuster after simply disconnecting from your games, if that is the case then we strongly recommend you diagnose the problem before receiving an even harsher punishment. It&#8217;s likely a simple fault with your Internet Service Provider or router. If you&#8217;ve replaced your router and restarted it multiple times, then it may be <a href="https://www.broadbandgenie.co.uk/broadband/help/how-to-switch-broadband">time to consider switching your broadband provider</a> to ensure you get low ping and a stable connection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Valorant, Riot&#8217;s sister FPS game also has a LeaveBuster and AntiCheat software. Players have also complained about wrongly being punished for disconnecting from the Valorant matches. However, this does appear to have been fixed somewhat by now.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve all been in League games where someone disconnected shortly after the initial remake grace period and wondered if it was intentional or not. Even if you do end up winning and getting a massive rush of dopamine from a well fought and deserved win, we always hold resentment to the one who disconnected.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would probably end up typing &#8220;gg&#8221; in all chat and even the enemies chat if they were being nice. Players who disconnect intentionally are a hindrance to the competitive aspect of the game and we want Riot to do something about it.</p>

<p>If you were the one who disconnected and was inevitably punished, the first thing you need to do is gather some information. If you didn&#8217;t record your game, chances are you&#8217;ll never have evidence strong enough to convince a support rep that you did not intentionally leave a game. The best thing you can do is write down the date, time, champion played, amount of players and their roles when the disconnect happened. The next step would be to go into your support tab on the League of Legends website and submit a ticket. Whilst this may seem a bit extreme to do over a single game, the difference between Master, Grand Master, and Challenger can be several LP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before heading into a ranked game, we&#8217;d always recommend <a href="https://www.speedtest.net">testing out your internet connection</a> in a practice or normal game to make sure you don&#8217;t get caught out and punished wrongly by the LeaveBuster. Even Riot can&#8217;t control what your ISP or router does when they receive your commands to disconnect, but they can at least have some degree of control over the LeaveBuster.</p>
