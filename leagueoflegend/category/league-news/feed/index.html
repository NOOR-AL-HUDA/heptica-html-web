<p>Technology has come a long way in the past few years. Manufacturers have figured out ways to fit better components into smaller spaces. We’ve also taken leaps ahead in terms of the battery life and build quality of portable devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These advancements raise a fair question in many of our minds. Have gaming laptops finally become complete, viable replacements to their desktop counterparts? Well, let’s jump into the topic and find out.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Understanding Gaming Laptops</strong></h2>



<p>The world of gaming laptops is fascinating. However, it can also be pretty overwhelming to beginners. Let’s break this down into smaller parts and understand what lies here.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Origins</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Gaming laptops exist for a very simple reason. Portability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once upon a time, PC gaming was confined to a big, bulky desktop. You had limited options if you wanted to play with other gamers. You would have to either play online or carry around your gigantic setup and fix it up in the place you’re going to play. This, obviously, proved to be very inconvenient and time-consuming. Not to mention the danger of destroying your multi-thousand dollar PC Build. Computer manufacturers took note of these issues. They came up with a solution—gaming laptops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Companies made more powerful, specialized laptops for gaming; these had better CPUs, cooling systems, computing power, and GPUs. These upgrades allowed them to run the latest games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notable early gaming laptops include the Alienware Aurora m9700. Talk about a chunky beast. It was released in 2006. Then we have the Razer Blade. Razer released this laptop in 2012. Also, it comes closer to modern gaming laptops in terms of size and power. Now they had their shortcomings. They were mainly overheating and had poor long-term quality. These laptops were indeed significant developments in portable PC gaming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaming laptops rose in popularity throughout the 2010s. It was also during this period of time that we saw significant improvements in their performance, usability, portability, space management, and design.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Current Status</strong></h3>



<p>Gaming laptops have become uber-capable machines. They now have multiple uses apart from just gaming. They’re now used for designing graphics, editing videos, visual effects, 3D animation, and also developing games. The latest laptops in the market are ready to go head to head against desktop PCs. Companies like Nvidia and AMD also pay specific attention to the development of gaming laptops and their required hardware/software.</p>



<p>The future seems bright for gaming laptops. The reason being, they’ve proven to just get better and better as each year passes by.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Considering One in 2021?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Now let’s get down to business. I’m going to write arguments in favor of and against buying gaming laptops in 2021, hoping to clarify the choice for you.</p>



<h3><strong>Argument For Gaming Laptops</strong></h3>



<p>Gaming laptops have gotten insanely good recently. So much so that you don’t even need a separate laptop for work and replacing your desktop. Your gaming laptop can do it all, alongside providing you with a grand gaming experience. Moreover, high spec laptops have become common at accessible prices. In other words, gaming laptops are serious contenders in the battle of legitimately capable machines.</p>



<p>Simply said, 2021 is a great time to buy a new gaming laptop. This is primarily because of the releases of brand new GPUs (NVidia RTX3000 Series &amp; AMD Radeon 6000s Series), CPUs from AMD and Intel, and newer processors. As a result, gaming laptops are currently priced pretty competitively. In addition, new chips are unlikely to arrive before 2023. So you should be set for the next few years if you purchase a gaming laptop right now. Therefore, making them a good option.</p>



<p>Gaming setups with laptops don’t have to make heavy sacrifices like they had to in the past. You no longer have to be at a desk to get the most from your gaming laptop. Improved battery life and connectivity options are slowly making true wireless gaming a dream come true. For instance, the introduction of 5G has undoubtedly helped in remote connectivity. Starlink’s 20-millisecond internet latency is also a fantastic addition to gaming laptops. Advancements in technology have made them thinner and lighter than ever before.</p>



<p>Most high-end gaming laptops in 2021 can even beat new next-gen consoles in performance levels, primarily due to their high refresh rates, better GPUs, processing power, and Dual-screen setups. You can even get fancy Quad-HD laptops now. They look amazing.</p>



<p>Modern gaming laptops also provide great flexibility in choice. Much more compared to their earlier models. Now, there is a wide variety of gaming laptops to choose from. Some companies even let you customize your own laptop!</p>



<p>Unlike a few years ago, you aren’t really missing out on much by choosing laptop GPUs over desktop ones. Laptop GPUs offer similar features, like access to AMD’s FSR. They now have ray tracing support, DLSS, and shadow plates with Nvidia; having a built-in hardware encoder also helps. Separate GPUs for desktops have become notoriously scarce in 2021. Owing to their shortages in supply to the Covid-19 pandemic, cryptocurrency boom, and the rise in PC demand due to remote work. This shortage has made desktop GPU prices soar out of the grasps of the average gamer. Gaming laptops, however, are still readily available in stock online and at non-inflated prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a nutshell, gaming laptops appear to be more value for money in 2021 than their desktop counterparts.</p>

<h3><strong>Argument Against Gaming Laptops</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="538" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/are-gaming-laptops-still-worth-it-1024x538.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-13511" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/are-gaming-laptops-still-worth-it-1024x538.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/are-gaming-laptops-still-worth-it-300x158.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/are-gaming-laptops-still-worth-it-768x403.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/are-gaming-laptops-still-worth-it-150x79.jpeg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/are-gaming-laptops-still-worth-it-750x394.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/are-gaming-laptops-still-worth-it-1140x599.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/are-gaming-laptops-still-worth-it.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Let’s face it. Gaming laptops are just not as powerful as high-powered desktops. There’s still a noticeable gap in their GPUs. Which in turn brings about a gap in game frame rates. Gaming laptops also provide way less upgradability than desktop PCs. with desktop PCs being totally modular. These laptops also have a higher long-term cost of ownership compared to desktops. Hence. It’s not uncommon that a gaming laptop becomes obsolete in around five years or so. Safe to say that if you aren’t moving around a lot, desktops prove to be a better overall choice.</p>



<p>Another glaring issue in gaming laptops is their size. How, you ask? Well, basically, while their small size is great for portability, it brings about an issue in the cooling department. Their compact size is a hurdle for internal components like thermals, acoustics. They’re too cramped for proper airflow. Therefore leading to heating issues. Most new high-power gaming laptops regularly reach temperatures like 90° F due to poor cooling. The excess heat also reduces the silicon lifespan and overall longevity of your device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cooling fans might help with heating issues, but they bring along their own problem. The annoying whirring sound that irks most people. While it is less noticeable in expensive laptops, the problem worsens as you head down the price ranges. To fix this, you can lower the power in some gaming laptops, but at the cost of decreasing your fps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another option is to get a larger gaming laptop that allocates more space for cooling. However, a large, heavy laptop beats the point of portability, doesn’t it? This issue makes headphones a must for an immersive gaming session.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although battery life in gaming laptops has come a long way since 2011, even now, there are limited laptops with excellent battery life. Plus, the batteries don’t deliver enough wattage without having a damaging effect on performance. Sure, gaming laptops can provide mobility. However, many still require charging cables and an AC connection for true, uncompromised gaming.</p>



<h2><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2>



<p>The answer to whether gaming laptops are worth it in 2021 really depends on what you want. They make sense if you are always on the move or want to pick up your laptop and game anywhere. The answer isn’t so clear if portability is not one of your primary concerns. In that case, a desktop might be the PC for you.</p>



<p>Gaming laptops today are much better than in the past. They make for great upgrades to older PCs. Just go through all the advantages and disadvantages and compare them to your needs.</p>



<p><strong>In conclusion, purchasing a gaming laptop in 2021 is an intelligent choice.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I will say it immediately: If you are under the age of 18, please close this article and move along. There are other interesting topics to see on our website, and betting is a dangerous practice that can cause severe addiction.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>We do not condone nor encourage unconscious betting, especially with minors. </em></p>



<p>With the disclaimer out of the way, let me begin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sports betting is one of the most lucrative businesses that has ever existed. The people’s need for an extra adrenaline rush and a way of possibly earning money while watching what they like is very, very present. It is within human nature to like and enjoy betting, and it’s just how things are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Betting does tend to get toxic, can destroy lives, and cause severe addiction. Consciously and responsibly, betting is the only way to keep yourself out of its prowling grasp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>eSports are no exception, and there are many sites (with more appearing every day) that offer users ways of betting on eSports events.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this brief list, we will go over what we believe is the current best. There isn’t too much information about these sites if you haven’t experienced them yourself. As someone that avoids betting in general, I’ve gathered some quick and brief information for you to understand what the site is offering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m going to repeat once again: If you are not over the age of 18, please leave this article and enjoy our plentiful League of Legends content. We put a lot of effort into it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s begin, then.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Bet365</strong></h2>



<p>Bet365 is one of the staple names in online betting. Though mostly reserved for regular sports and providing many intuitive ways of tracking the game you’re betting on, they also offer a wide variety of eSports options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Bet365, you’ll have the opportunity to bet on all major eSports events and titles out there. The site is simple, looks nice, and works flawlessly. The live score updates also work great, meaning that you won’t have to refresh every second.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also In-Play betting available for those who wish to jump into the action after the fact. I have some brief experience with this site, and I recommend it if you want to bet.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. </strong><a href="https://ggbetpromo.com/l/61581f84a5c2682fca41bfd4"><strong>GG.Bet</strong></a><strong> &#8211; Best Overall</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="485" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-lol-betting-sites-1024x485.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-14570" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-lol-betting-sites-1024x485.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-lol-betting-sites-300x142.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-lol-betting-sites-768x363.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-lol-betting-sites-150x71.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-lol-betting-sites-750x355.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-lol-betting-sites-1140x540.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-lol-betting-sites.jpg 1346w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>GG.Bet is probably one you’ve already heard of. They often appear at tournaments as sponsors of either the teams or the event or even both. I’ve seen them multiple times in various eSports events across many video games, namely in CSGO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one of the biggest eSports betting names out there, they take great care about their eSports betting department. The site is easy to navigate, immediately shows you the hot events to bet on, and is pleasant to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also upwards of <a href="https://ggbetpromo.com/l/61581f84a5c2682fca41bfd4">150$ of welcome bonuses</a>. This makes many people love the site and choose to stay at it, at least until they expend the bonus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a solid number of games available to bet on, it’s certainly a good option for those with a burning wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Unibet</strong></h2>



<p>Unibet is a solid site that is well-rounded from all sides. It is up there among the best and feels very balanced in every way – the odds, the design, and welcome bonuses are all good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For eSports betting, it gives upwards of 50 GBP of welcome bonuses, which is nice and will help you stay for at least a while. Every leading eSports title is available to bet on, meaning that you won’t miss out if you venture out of League’s domain into some other popular game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other than that, there’s a solid number of games to bet on, and you won’t run out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve had some issues with the site not loading in properly, but apart from that, it’s just solid without too many specialties.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Betway</strong></h2>



<p>Like <a href="https://ggbetpromo.com/l/61581f84a5c2682fca41bfd4">GG.Bet</a>, Betway is the name you’ve likely heard before. They also sponsor many eSports events and teams, and they never miss an opportunity to mark their presence in this sphere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Betway will offer players to bet on live eSports games, allowing you to make a bet if you’ve missed it beforehand. With generous welcome bonuses, it will keep you playing on their site, which is well designed and looks nice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s exceptionally easy to navigate, and finding the hottest live events is but a click of a button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outside of the League of Legends betting circle, there’s a wide range of eSports titles available to bet on. If there’s nothing interesting or the League of Legends eSports is on hold – you can venture into some other eSports titles with great odds that give you a bigger shot at winning.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a sea of websites around the internet that offer you eSports betting. These are just some of them that I’ve had the “unfortunate” opportunity of grazing. I do not approve of unconscious, reckless, and irresponsible gambling, and I warn everyone with a wish to get into it – please restrain yourself for the safety of yourself and those around you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, the same goes for minors who should, under no circumstance, get themselves into gambling, betting, or other luck-based endeavors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please stay safe when taking part in gambling, and we wish you the best of luck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These lists take time and effort to make, so leave feedback to help us improve them. Keep a keen eye out on our website for more League of Legends-related content such as articles, guides, and lists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We all know that League of Legends is one of the most popular online games in the world, but we never really knew how big League of Legends really is. It&#8217;s time to find out the total League of Legends player count<strong>.</strong> League of Legends player count in 2021 is no joke. Its player count has grown year by year and is now one of the most played multiplayer games in the world and <em>the</em> most played Esport in the world.</p>



<p>League of Legends, a game developed by Riot Games in 2009 has gained heavy popularity in recent years. It started in 2009 with a few hundred thousand players, quickly gained traction, and reached 11 million players by 2011, which then again takes a huge leap to 65 million players in 2014 and a further bigger leap of 100 million players in 2017. After that, the League of Legends player base had a slight drop in its player count to 75 million in 2018 but has made a comeback in 2020 with a range of 100-120 million players. </p>

<p><strong>Even though a lot of people think that League of Legends is a dying game, the numbers are telling us a completely different story. League of Legends player count in 2021 has reached a total number of 115 million active monthly users! With these crazy stats, we just can&#8217;t see League dying in the near future!

<h2><strong>How did League of Legends Rise in Popularity?</strong></h2>



<p>In the beginning, LoL was a very different game. Today we have our fair match-making system, understandable gameplay, and as many skins as we want. And the only problematic thing that we can agree on is the client, which sometimes takes on its own.</p>



<p>But, some League of Legends players may remember a time where there was actual chaos in the game. Laggy servers and buggy gameplay &#8211; no one was immune to the numerous issues that arose every day. So, how did a game like League of Legends rose to such high numbers of active players on a daily basis?</p>



<p>First of all, we have to give credit to Riot Games for addressing a large percent of the issues. Champions were fixed, items were removed and new ones added, new map features were introduced. And in the end, we ended up with the League mode we have now. Regular patch updates, bug fixes, and in-depth beta testing are just parts of it.</p>



<p>League of Legends started in North America. In the beginning, the NA server was the only existing one. And the European and the other servers came almost a year later. But despite everything, the interest in the game kept growing since day one. Why is that?</p>



<p>Well, we can say that it’s because League of Legends is such a great game. And we wouldn’t be wrong because, at the time, it was a brand new sensation in the world of competitive video games. A 5v5 PvP arena that required knowledge, skill, and strategy.</p>



<p>Those were the fundamental things that launched LoL in the world of Esports. And Esports made LoL more popular than it could’ve ever been imagined!</p>



<h2><strong>League of Legends Esports</strong></h2>



<p>It’s no secret that Esports massively influenced the growth of League of Legends’ player count. It helped spread LoL around the world and made it more popular than ever. So how does the professional Esports League of Legends scene work?</p>



<p>Well, the LoL professional scene is divided into multiple leagues, each representing the region and servers they’re in. For example, the North American server and region have the NA LCS league throughout the year. Only the best teams from the United States, Canada, and the rest of NA are playing in the LCS. And the same goes for the European LEC, the South Korean LCK, the Chinese LPL, and the rest.</p>



<p>Now, all these individual leagues work towards the same goal &#8211; to launch their best team on an international scale. <strong>Mid-Season Invitational</strong>, or <strong>MSI</strong>, is the first international tournament that is happening each year for League of Legends. It’s hosted in different states and cities every time, and teams from all leagues participate in it. MSI is a very serious competition, organized by Riot Games themselves, and has been around since 2015.</p>



<p>However, the most important event for the League of Legends Esports world is the <strong>World Championship</strong>. <strong>Worlds </strong>is the final clash between the best teams at the end of the year. The LoL World Championship is the grandest Esports competition, and it has broken viewership numbers many times now. For example, the finals of Worlds 2028 had a record-breaking <strong>99.6 million unique viewers</strong> around the world. And just for a comparison, the American Superbowl in 2019 had only <strong>98.2 million</strong> <strong>viewers</strong>.</p>



<p>But, if there is one reason why the LoL Esports scene is getting so many viewers and the game so many more players, it’s the teams and players!</p>

<h2><strong>The Best League of Legends Esports Teams and Players</strong></h2>



<p>When we’re talking about pro League of Legends players, we really mean Legends. The situation is like in any other sport &#8211; the best players inspire the rest of us to try the game, improve, and become the best.</p>



<p>One person that deserves the most recognition for inspiring LoL players is <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Faker" target="_blank">Faker</a></strong>. Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok is a true icon within the League of Legends community. His debut match back in season 3 in the LCK league showed us his extraordinary talent for the game. Over the next couple of years, Faker would go on and win most of the home and international tournaments. He developed into the absolute <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-league-players/" data-type="post" data-id="11685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best League of Legends player</a> of all time.</p>



<p>But, Faker isn’t the only influential figure in the community. Pros like <strong>Bjergsen</strong>, <strong>Doublelift</strong>, <strong>Meteos</strong>, <strong>Diamondprox</strong>, <strong>xPeke</strong>, and many more have inspired a lot of people to join or stay with the game as well. And today’s stars like <strong>Caps</strong>, <strong>ShowMaker</strong>, <strong>Perkz</strong>, <strong>Deft</strong>, and <strong>SofM</strong>, are only continuing that tradition.</p>



<p>On the other hand, teams like <strong>Team SoloMid</strong>, <strong>T1</strong>, <strong>G2 Esports</strong>, <strong>Cloud 9</strong>, <strong>Fnatic</strong>, and others have left a true legacy behind them. Fans around the globe cheer for their teams and regard them as a vital reason why they’re still watching and playing the game. So, you can clearly see how the League of Legends Esports scene has influenced the growth of the game’s player base throughout the year.</p>



<h2><strong>Did Streamers Influence LoL’s Playerbase?</strong></h2>



<p>Definitely yes! Thanks to streaming, League has become the most-watched Esports title. During an important event, like the World Championship, third-party platforms like Twitch and YouTube gather to 500 000 live viewers on Riot Game’s official channels. And during the regular days, League’s viewership on Twitch stays on the number one spot &#8211; 150 000 &#8211; 200 000 average viewers live every second! No other video game has come even close.</p>



<p>Now, the big reason why League has so much attention on Twitch is the actual streamers themselves. Characters like <strong>Tyler1</strong>, <strong>Imaqtpie</strong>, <strong>Gross Gore</strong>, <strong>Doublelift</strong>, and <strong>Midbeast</strong>, gather tremendous amounts of audience people every day. They have a massive fanbase and followers that contribute to the League of Legends player count. They perform and teach other players how to be better at the game, resulting in a steady growth-over-time effect for League’s popularity too.</p>



<p>Nearly all professional League of Legends players have tried streaming too. <strong>Faker</strong>, <strong><a href="https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Caps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Caps</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Perkz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perkz</a></strong> are among the most famous ones. They don’t have the widest of schedules when it comes to streaming, but they still make efforts to steam during their free time.</p>



<p>Streaming is a fantastic tool for marketing and publishing content, which is why it also works wonderfully for LoL. It’s easily accessible, and anyone can watch/stream their favorite games for free. League of Legends has been part of the streaming business since day one. People enjoy watching others managing to defeat their own opponents. We can learn much from other’s people mistakes, and League players are willing to put in the time to advance their skills in the game.</p>



<p>So, as much as the international tournaments have influenced League’s player numbers, the streamers have nearly that much too!</p>

<p>This is the year Riot Games first announced an official statement with the number of players they had. It showed us in a cute little <strong>League of Legends player count graph</strong></p>

<ul><li>32.5 Million registrations&nbsp;</li><li>11.5 Million monthly players</li><li>4.2 Million daily players&nbsp;</li><li>1.3 Million players playing at the same time.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>Moving into the next year Riot Games released another statement about League of Legends player count. They had again given a nifty infographic to help understand the state of the game in 2012.</p>



<p>What we can take away from the League of Legends graph is that League of Legends had</p>



<ul><li>70 Million registrations</li><li>32 Million monthly players</li><li>12 Million daily players</li><li>3 Million concurrent players.</li></ul>

<p>Fast-forwarding two years into the future, Riot Games released another official statement giving details about the state of League of Legends. This time they had not come with any infographics but rather straight up information.</p>



<p>From the statement released by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161105050036/http://riot-web-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/November_2011/2011_11_17_lol_numbers/riot_lol_infographic_full.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games</a>, we understand that League of Legends now had</p>



<ul><li>65 Million monthly players</li><li>27 Million daily players</li><li>8 Million peak concurrent players</li></ul>



<p>Although Riot didn&#8217;t release as much information as before it was still apparent League of Legends was still growing. It had taken a lot longer than previously, but Riot had managed to double their monthly and daily players bringing the total monthly players to 67 million.</p>



<h2><strong>League of Legends player count in 2017- 100 MILLION</strong></h2>



<p>Riot did not release any statement when they reached this mark, but according to analytical data and certain League of Legends graphs, we understand that the League of Legends player count had reached about 100 Million monthly players in 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If League of Legends was a country, it would be ranked at the 15th Position as the population per country out of the 200+ countries in the world. That is right, there are only 15 countries in 2020 that have a population of over 100 million.</p>



<h2><strong>League of Legends player count in 2018 &#8211; 75 MILLION</strong></h2>



<p>As to how all games have, League of Legends also had its drop in its player count. But not to worry as League of Legends has gained back its position in 2020 because of the number of Events they held and the amount of marketing that had been done. By now, we had amazing cinematics and also music by many popular creators such as Linkin Park.</p>

<p>League of Legends and Dota 2 are the world’s biggest MOBA games. However, the difference in the player count between these two games is massive. While Dota 2 has around<a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 11 active monthly users</a>,<strong> League of Legends has 115 million active monthly users, which makes League around 10 times bigger than Dota 2.</strong> Also, League of Legends has around 50 million daily active players in 2021, while Dota 2 only has 1 million daily players.</p>



<h3><strong>League of Legends vs Minecraft</strong></h3>



<p>Minecraft is the world’s most popular video game on many different gaming platforms, such as Twitch and YouTube Gaming. In 2021, Minecraft’s player base has risen to a whopping 125 million active monthly players, which is “only” 10 million more than the League of Legends player base. These stats really put a good perspective on how big League of Legends really is.</p>



<h3><strong>League of Legends vs CS:GO</strong></h3>



<p>CSGO is one of the biggest FPS games in the world and still has only <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">26 Million monthly players</a>. League of Legends almost has 100 Million more than that!</p>



<p>Now you know how popular League of Legends is and I hope this article can help you convince that friend who keeps saying League of Legends is a small indie game made by a small indie company.</p>



<p>Are you surprised by these numbers? If you are, then you&#8217;ll be even more surprised when you check out these <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/top-10-most-expensive-league-of-legends-skins-and-their-value-in-2020/">most expensive skins in League of Legends</a>!</p>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Each year, the number of League of Legends players numbers grows more and more. This steady rise has been here since the very beginning of the game. We’re very fortunate to see our favorite game having such a great success, despite the fact that more than 10 years have passed since we first entered the Summoner’s Rift. The truth is, no video game title has ever stayed on the top of the popularity charts like League of Legends.</p>



<p>Riot Games deserve much credit for listening to their general audience when it comes to the actual game itself and the professional scene. People who play League of Legends generally want to be connected to it, even when they aren’t playing the game. And all the books, cinematics, apps, streams, and talk shows, have done exactly that &#8211; bring the world of LoL closer to us all!</p>



<p>That said, we’re excited to see what the future hold for us, League of Legends players. Every year, Riot Games manages to introduce new things and keep us engaged. And we’re hoping that that will remain the same for a very long time. May the numbers of millions and millions of players rise even more!</p>

<p>Laptops are undeniably amazing. They combine the portability of a tablet with the usability and power of a desktop. Additionally, with advancements in tech, laptops are only getting better and more attractive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laptops give you the flexibility to work on the go without having to compromise a lot in terms of performance and capability. No matter where you may be, you have your trusty laptop with you to help you out with school and professional work. Furthermore, a laptop also has its own keyboard and mouse, so you don’t have to worry about carrying them around. Having a dedicated physical keyboard is an undeniable edge that laptops have over tablets because they’re way more convenient to use than touchscreen ones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Have I mentioned the variety of gorgeous designs that laptops come in? From sleek business ultrabooks to RGB-laden monster machines. What&#8217;s more, is that laptops have unique designs for every taste and preference.</p>



<p>If we talk about performance, then gone are the days that laptops were only limited to minor tasks like editing documents or surfing the internet. Undoubtedly, laptops are now capable enough to go head to head with some high-performance desktop PCs too. Moreover, you can get quality laptops for every use. From schoolwork to managing spreadsheets, from video editing to hardcore gaming! Additionally, there is a large variety of laptops tailored for specific uses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, laptops come in a wide range of prices. They can start from around $400 for budget laptops that are great for casual daily use, all the way up to a few thousand bucks too for the high-end machines.</p>



<p>Obviously, all this variety might make you wonder, ‘So how much should I pay for one of these?’. I had the same question. To answer it, I’ve researched and compiled a complete guide to make sure that you know how much you need to spend on a laptop and why.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em><strong>In a hurry? Here are the best gaming laptops in 2021!</strong></em></p>

<h2><strong>Are Gaming Laptops Worth It?</strong></h2>



<p>Firstly, the market size of gaming laptops just seems to be growing larger and larger by the year. Significantly owing to the rise in popularity of gaming and online streaming and also due to the fact that they’re just so good. In the past few years, gaming laptops have certainly gotten way better than they were before. Additionally, they’ve also gotten down to much more accessible prices, with budget ones starting from as low as $900. What&#8217;s more, is that some manufacturers let you mix and match and customize your own gaming laptop.</p>



<p>2021 is certainly looking like an excellent year to purchase a gaming laptop. AMD and Intel recently released new processors. In addition, brand new graphics card lineups have arrived from Nvidia and AMD. Therefore, the pricing of gaming laptops is competitive right now. Basically, if you buy a gaming laptop right now, you should be good for the coming few years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, one might think that gaming laptops are only for gamers, but that is far from the truth. They’re portable beasts that can get just about anything done. Being such powerful machines, gaming laptops can be your go-to for any heavy performance task. You can use them for gaming, video editing, 3D animation, visual effects, sound design, and coding. In other words, basically anything under the sun.</p>



<p>Considering all the listed factors, without a doubt, it seems like gaming laptops are definitely worth it. So here, I’ve compiled a short list of awesome gaming laptops in each price range; budget, mid-range, and high-end.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Average Cost of a Laptop</strong></h2>



<p>Let’s leave the world of gaming and come back to good old regular laptops. Firstly, let&#8217;s look at the average prices of laptops at various price points. For example, on average, the cost of a new laptop is between $600-$750. In this range, you can find many capable Chromebooks and Ultrabooks that satisfy your needs. However, there is a world above and below this estimate too. If the laptops you find between these figures don’t catch your eye, you can go on and find great picks at other prices too.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What Are the Price Ranges? </strong></h2>



<p>Like other pieces of tech, laptops are priced in three categories: budget laptops, mid-range laptops, and high-end laptops. In short, the price of the laptop pretty much decides what you’re going to get. According to your requirements, you can choose a laptop at different prices.</p>



<h2><strong>Budget Laptops: $400-$500</strong></h2>



<p>You might think that buying a laptop at such low prices will not get you a nice device, but that’s far from the truth, my friend. In fact, in recent years, there has been an upswing in entry-level sound options that can perform well. They now come with all-day batteries, Full-HD displays, and solid performance figures. So you don’t have to break the bank anymore if you want a laptop that can get your work done properly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this price, you have the option of getting a Chromebook. These are budget-friendly laptops that run on Google’s web-based Chrome OS. Chromebooks are great for younger students and users that don’t expect heavy performance from their laptops.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from coming at significantly lower prices than Windows laptops, they get better battery life and tend to be less prone to viruses and security threats too. Most importantly, another pro is that some Chromebooks can run Android apps from the Google Play Store, therefore giving them access to thousands of apps and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there is a catch. Chromebooks rely too much on the internet to function and can leave you in a pickle if you don’t have a stable internet connection. In addition, Chromebooks also tend to be less powerful than their Windows counterparts and can run fewer programs.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of a few of these value-priced laptops:</p>



<h3><strong>1. <a href="https://amzn.to/3iCcjBY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASUS VivoBook 15</a></strong></h3>

<h2><strong>Why Are High-End Laptops the Best?</strong></h2>



<p>Looking at these exorbitant prices, you’ll almost certainly wonder, “What makes these laptops better than the others?” To break it down, higher prices generally mean better build quality, better performance, better security, better software, and overall, a better experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thing is, you’re going to be spending hours on this machine a day. For the time that your laptop is with you, it will likely be your workstation, something you get your entertainment from, along with storage for important files and stuff. Accordingly, it makes sense to invest in one that can improve your productivity and provide you with a good user experience daily.</p>



<p>Higher-end laptops are usually durable and future-proofed. This means that they have the software and hardware that can handle updates and new requirements in the coming future. To back that up, the quality of materials used in the laptop can make sure that your laptop lasts you for a good while without breaking down and becoming obsolete.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If sound and picture quality is important to you, then these laptops have you covered. Expensive laptops often include sound systems from dedicated sound companies like Bang &amp; Olufsen. Their screens offer outstanding picture quality with FHD, UHD, 4k, and also Retina displays. This ensures that you can stream your favorite content on these laptops like it was meant to be streamed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Battery life is another critical difference between high-end and budget laptops. Most of the time, manufacturers sacrifice battery life to allow them to sell laptops at lower prices. It’s safe to say that battery life is one of the most significant components of laptops. After all, what’s the use of a laptop if you have to plug it into a socket every few hours? You don’t have to worry about this with high-end laptops. The battery on these beasts can easily last you the whole working day with high use. Some can even roll over to the next day and keep going.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps you’re a user with very high requirements from your laptop. In short, this pretty much eliminates budget and mid-range laptops from your list. What you need is a machine that can compete with well-made desktop PCs in the laptop form factor. Again, the more expensive laptops have your back here. They can run any software with ease, giving you a seamless work experience. There are laptops now that can even edit 4K video on the go!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Why Are Laptops So Expensive Right Now? </strong></h2>



<p>One thing you might notice if you’re scouring the laptop markets right now is the spike in prices across ranges. Laptop prices are getting hiked by up to $50 throughout the market. You can thank the global chip shortage for these increases in prices. The reason behind the chip shortages seems to be the crypto-mining boom, increased device sales owing to the pandemic, and a worldwide upswing in cloud computing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Things have gotten so serious that President Joe Biden declared in June that he would assign a task force to look into this matter. Current developments suggest that we’re going to have to deal with this issue throughout the year and likely into next year as well.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Find the Best Value for Money Laptop?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Finding a suitable value-for-money laptop might seem intimidating with all the options in the market. However, it’s actually pretty simple. Let’s see how.</p>



<p>You need to straighten your priorities while buying a laptop. This means that you have to go through what your requirements are from the machines. What will your use be? Undoubtedly, different uses require attention to different parameters while buying. What is important to you in a laptop and how much are you willing to pay for it?</p>



<h3><strong>Criteria for a VFM Laptop</strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong>Portability</strong></li></ul>



<p>Not many things are more redundant in the tech world than a laptop that is not portable. Your laptop needs to be light and handy for you to be able to carry it around and get your work done. In addition to that, it should also have a sturdy and durable build quality that should inspire confidence within you to take it anywhere, without fearing damage. Good thing for us, most laptops nowadays have toughened up while remaining sleek and portable. Aim for a laptop around 2 kgs (4.4 lbs) and you’ll be fine.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Battery Life</strong></li></ul>



<p>Battery life and portability go hand-in-hand. I mean, you can’t really carry around a laptop that dies in a few hours and expect to get any work done. This is where you might want to go for a higher-priced laptop because they tend to have better battery life. You should look at getting a laptop with an “all-day battery”, or around 8 hours of use. Most laptops around the $650 mark will get you this much.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Brand</strong></li></ul>



<p>How much does the brand of a laptop matter? If you’d asked me that question about a decade ago, my answer would’ve been, “Yes, very much”. However, things have changed in recent years and they’ve changed for the better. In 2021, you can go right ahead and buy a laptop from any brand you’ve heard of before and expect to get a quality product. In the VFM budget category, you have noteworthy contenders from Mi, Lenovo, and Acer. Although, the PC giants Dell and HP have also released some great laptops in the budget price range.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Performance</strong></li></ul>



<p>A solid combination of the CPU, GPU, and Memory makes for great performance in a laptop. Recommended specs for a laptop purchase in 2021 are 8 gigs of RAM, 512 GB of SSD storage, and 4 gigabytes of dedicated VRAM (Video RAM). Most mid-range laptops have these specifications at pretty reasonable prices. You can expect to pay around $600-$700 for a laptop that offers this level of performance.</p>



<h2><strong>How Long Does the Average Laptop Last?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Now you know how to make a laptop purchase that will work for you. However, how long will your snazzy new laptop last before it either:</p>



<ol><li><em>Fails to keep up with improvements in technology and becomes obsolete</em></li></ol>



<p><strong>or</strong></p>



<ol start="2"><li><em>It starts requiring regular repairs and eventually breaks down </em></li></ol>



<p>On average, a typical mid-range laptop’s lifespan is between 2-4 years. You can generally be safe to expect your laptop to work perfectly during this time. After this, however, there really is no guarantee of how long it’ll last. Regardless, if you take good care of it, you can get a laptop to last for around 10 years! However, if you want to have a laptop with the latest tech, it’s a good idea to replace your laptop every 4 years or so. All things considered, a good idea is to get a durable laptop with the latest specs that can last you 4 years with no issues.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How to Maintain a Laptop?</strong></h2>



<p>Here are some quick tips that’ll help you increase the lifespan of your laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Keep your laptop away from exposure to dust and liquid.</li><li>Regularly wipe down your laptop on the outside and thoroughly clean it every 5-6 months, eliminating dust and other gunk stuck in it.</li><li>Keep your laptop nice and cool. Refrain from using it in hot rooms and conditions that can cause it to overheat.&nbsp;</li><li>Update the essential software on your laptop as they arrive. That’ll keep you up to date with bug fixes and security patches to have a smoother, risk-free experience.&nbsp;</li><li>Install reputable anti-virus software to boost your laptop’s security.&nbsp;</li><li>Avoid always using your laptop till 0% because this can damage its battery. A good rule of thumb is to use your laptop when it’s in between 40-80% charge.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2><strong>When’s the Best Time for Buying a Laptop?</strong></h2>



<p>Did you know? Laptop prices can vary depending on the time of the year. It’s necessary to know this information to ensure you don’t overspend on a laptop you could get at a lower price by just waiting a bit.</p>



<p>In summer, Amazon Prime Day gets you crazy good deals on laptops. Autumn is an excellent time to buy a new laptop, with all the back-to-school offers and, of course, Black Friday. If you want a new MacBook, autumn makes sense for you too. As a matter of fact, after the September Apple events and new MacBook launches, older MacBooks have become significantly cheaper. You can get great discounts around the holiday season too. You should generally avoid early summer, as there’s not much going on in May and June, and you won’t get the best bang for your buck by making a purchase then.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>To sum it up, spending anywhere between $650 and $800 seems reasonable for most buyers. Thankfully, current mid-range laptops in this scale come packed with all the essentials to make your life easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in the end, the price that you should pay for a laptop will vary according to your needs.</p>

<p>VPN is one of the most popular services in our modern-day world. But playing League of Legends with VPN is one of those topics people are very conflicted about. There are some positive and some negative sides to it. And in this post, we’ll talk about all of them!</p>



<p>But before we do so, know that the idea of playing League of Legends with VPN isn’t a new one. People had always tried to make it work, even when the game was still young. First, because they wanted to keep their privacy and separate their LoL accounts from their real-life personalities. And second, for some people, VPN is the only way to actually access League!</p>



<p><strong><em>How is that possible?</em></strong></p>



<p>Well, let’s first understand what exactly VPN is how it operates. Then we’ll explore why you should or shouldn’t play League of Legends with a VPN service on!</p>



<h2><strong>What is VPN?</strong></h2>



<p>VPN stands for <strong>virtual private network, </strong>and its only goal is to give you<strong> privacy and anonymity while being on the internet.</strong> </p>



<h2><strong><em>How do the VPN companies do this?</em></strong></h2>



<p>Well, they do it by disguising your actual IP address and hiding it from the internet. So when you search the internet or play games online, the VPN company sends that data from their base rather than your own IP. That’s why through VPN, you can acquire a different IP every time you log in on the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, all the searches and all the traffic that you do while you have a VPN on is transformed into an unreadable code by the VPN service. This way, no one can actually see what you’re doing on the internet and who’s doing all those searches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And for gamers, this may sound ideal! Being able to connect to everyone on the internet and play League of Legends with them while your identity is secured seems like the dream, doesn’t it?&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, using a VPN for gaming does have some major implications for the safety of your accounts!</p>



<p>So let’s talk about those implications!</p>

<h2><strong>Can You Play League of Legends with VPN?</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-1024x604.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12529" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-1024x604.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-300x177.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-768x453.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-750x443.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN-1140x673.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/is-it-possible-to-play-league-with-VPN.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Short answer &#8211; yes! You can totally play League of Legends with any VPN service, no matter whether it’s free or premium. Changing your IP address and hiding your current location doesn’t necessarily stop you from login into your LoL account, but it may hurt you in the long run!</p>



<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>



<p>If you haven’t noticed, Riot Games have been really dedicated to making their users (us, the players) as secure as possible lately. They’ve introduced free account name and password changes, but also email confirmations. And you simply must confirm that you’re the owner of the account by identifying yourself to Riot.</p>



<p>The reason why this is important is that the VPN services do the complete opposite to this!</p>



<h3><strong>So, where’s the conflict?</strong></h3>



<p>The real problem of playing League of Legends with VPN is that it changes your IP address &#8211; the same IP address that Riot Games identify you with in their data. So when you log in from a completely new location with the same account, Riot detects that as a possible hacking/selling/sharing that account!</p>



<p>If you log in three or four times to LoL in one day, each time using a different IP address, chances are that Riot will notice that. And they might be forced to put a stop to that account because, to them, it seems sketchy.</p>



<p>So should you or should you not use a VPN for playing League of Legends?</p>

<h2><strong>Should You Play League of Legends with VPN?</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="573" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-1024x573.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12528" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-1024x573.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-300x168.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-768x430.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-1536x860.jpeg 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-750x420.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn-1140x638.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/can-you-play-lol-with-vpn.jpeg 1909w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>In my opinion &#8211; no! The risk of getting your account banned is simply not worth it. And if your only reason for wanting to play LoL with VPN is just to secure yourself, my advice is to not even try it! You can use your VPN service for everything else you do on the internet, but you should disable it for logging into League.</p>



<p><strong><em>However, what if you can’t actually play League of Legends without a VPN?</em></strong></p>



<p>For some people, not having a VPN service is an issue for playing League. That’s because their own internet providers have pre-determined settings that block many potentially harmful sites and applications. And some of them detect League of Legends and other games as such.</p>



<p>But even though there are things you can do to unblock League of Legends and remove it from that list, VPN also solves that problem for you. It removes all those regulations that your internet provider might have for safety or otherwise. And the VPN lets you login into LoL and play!</p>



<p><strong>However, the same risks that we explained above remain!</strong></p>



<p>I’ve actually talked to many people who have been playing League of Legends with VPN successfully for years. They’ve never had an issue with banning or otherwise. However, you never know what might happen to you specifically. You might have the best of luck while using the VPN service, and you might have none. So the choice is only yours to make!</p>



<p>In the end, make sure to contact the Riot Games support service and explain your situation to them. They often try whatever they can to solve these kinds of problems!</p>

<p>Back in <a href="https://www.riftherald.com/lol-patch-notes/2017/7/12/15961680/lol-patch-7-14-lethality-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 7</a>, League of Legends introduced a new statistic. This is a change that was made in order to replace the flat armor penetration. Basically, you’re granted flat armor penetration using this formula:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Flat Armor Penetration = LETHALITY x (0.6 + 0.4 x level % 18)</strong></li></ul>



<p>During Season 7, flat armor penetration was changed and transformed into the new Lethality stats. Yes, they changed the name, and this was to clear up any confusion the LoL community may have. The previous name was “flat armor penetration,” and this suggested that it was good when going against targets with armor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth noting that some items are better on certain champions than on others. Take ability power as an example – this is used for wizards, armor, magic resistance on tanks, physical damage for those damage carriers, and assassins.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/ardentunited/league-of-lethality-e9e14a8e196d">Lethality originated in 2017</a> and is converted into fixed armor penetration. In LoL, there are actually four different types of calculations to reduce or penetrate the enemy’s armor: percentage armor reduction, fixed armor reduction, armor penetration, and Lethality. Don&#8217;t worry; we&#8217;ll explain each of them.</p>



<h2><strong>Fixed Armor Reduction</strong></h2>



<p>Under fixed armor reduction, the enemy’s armor can be reduced by a fixed amount. This reduction will cause the loss of an enemy’s temp armor. If the enemy has 20 armor, and you reduce 20, then this will leave your opponent standing there naked, with 0 armor. Fixed <a href="https://warframe.fandom.com/f/p/2027495406698497392">armor reduction</a> can exceed zero, which makes the attribute negative, increasing your damage even more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Percentage Armor Reduction</strong></h2>



<p>When you have a target hit by skill or an item that reduces the armor by a certain percentage, physical damage will be even more effective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take the Black Cleaver as an example; it has what we refer to as a “Slit” effect – this can reduce the enemy champions&#8217; armor by up to 24% (ouch). If the enemy champion has 100 armor, he/she will lose 24 and keep 76.</p>



<p><em>The Calculation for this:</em></p>



<p><strong>Current armor = total – (percentage) = 100 – (100 x 24/100) = 100 – 24 = 76</strong></p>



<p><strong>Also read: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/champion-weight-height-age-chart/" data-type="post" data-id="9383" target="_blank">League of Legends Champions’ Weight, Height, and Age Chart</a></strong></p>



<h2><strong>Percentage Armor Penetration</strong></h2>



<p>Unlike percentage armor reduction and fixed armor reduction, armor penetration is only guaranteed to the champion who applies it. The opponent’s resistance isn’t going to be reduced gradually or steadily for all physical damage, but only for the champion himself. This is an attribute used in damage carriers and is best applied when going against targets with a large amount of armor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The item called <a href="https://lol.gamepedia.com/Mortal_Reminder_(Item)">Mortal Reminder</a> applies 25% armor penetration. If you’re dealing with 100 physical resistance, this is going to result in 75.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Here’s the calculation:&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><strong>Current armor = total – (percentage) = 100 – (100 x 0.25 / 100) = 100 – 25 = 75</strong></p>



<h2><strong>LoL Lethality</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="458" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Slika-zaslona-2020-09-29-u-23.01.14-1024x458.png" alt="Lethality is a special effect in League of Legends which Riot released back in 2017.

<p>Lethality ignores a fixed value of the enemy champions armor, and it cannot exceed zero. This works as penetration and depends on the champion inflicting it. Riot balances Lethality in LoL by making it available little at a time, reaching the maximum Lethality at level 18.</p>



<p>When an item has this special trait, they’ll have a calculation that will let you know how much Lethality you’re gaining. Looking at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Duskblade_of_Draktharr" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duskblade of Draktharr</a>, it grants a total of 21 lethality, and it will give you a percentage of that before you reach level 18.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say you have a character at level 10; the formula would look like this:</p>



<p><strong>Fixed Armor Penetration = lethality x (0.6 + 0.4 x level / 18) = 21 x (0.6 + 0.4 x 10/18) = 21 x (0.6 + 0.4 x 0, 55) = 21 x (0.6 + 0.22) = 21 x 0.82 = 17.2</strong></p>



<h2><strong>An Even Closer Look at Lethality &#8211; How Does LoL Lethality Work?</strong></h2>



<p>Long story short, in League of Legends, Lethality is all about armor penetration. You can think of it as negative armor. The amount of Lethality you have would be the amount of armor removed from the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Here, let me give you an example to help you out…</em></p>



<p>Let’s say you’re dealing with Vayne on the other side – Vayne has 60 Armor, and you have 40 Lethality. This means that for you, Vayne will only have 20 Armor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 40 Lethality you have takes away 40 Armor from the enemy, but only 40 (because that’s what you have).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, you’re going up against a Rammus, and he has 500 Armor. For you, Rammus will have a total of 460 Armor because of your 40 Lethality. The 40 Lethality removes 40 Armor from his 500 Armor, which leaves him with 460.</p>



<p>Surely, this explanation has put a better perspective on why Assassins have been one-shotting Squishies and not Tanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are you scratching your head, trying to figure out the<em>&nbsp;difference between Lethality and Armor Penetration</em>? Let me explain …</p>



<p>Believe it or not, it’s really not all that complicated.&nbsp;<strong>LoL Lethality is flat, while Armor Penetration is based on a percentage.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>To make things easier, let’s go back to the example we gave you earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vayne has 60 Armor, and you have 45% Armor Penetration. Now, he will have 33 Armor, Whereas the Rammus we talked about who had 500 Armor is now going to have a total of 275 Armor (wow, that was a big drop, wasn’t it).&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you see, Lethality is a big help and makes it where the enemy barely has any Armor, but if you have an enemy that is stacking armor like a hamster stacks food in his mouth, Armor Penetration is going to be on your side.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Lethality Calculation LoL</strong></h2>



<p>The amount of Lethality you receive is going to increase, depending on the level of your League of Legends Champion. Riot Games made it easy for us to calculate Lethality – simply by hovering over the item, it will tell you how much Lethality you currently have on your champion.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1601412781403"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Is Lethality better than armor penetration?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Yes. In most cases it&#8217;s better to build items that will grant you lethality than those with armor penetration.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1601412827799"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Does damage reduction reduce True Damage?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Damage reduction effect reduces damage from lethality and armor penetration, but it will not reduce the damage from True damage effect.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1601412973416"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Do lethality items stack?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Riot removed unique lethality passive last year, which means that you can now stack more lethality items, which allows you to do even more damage!</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1601413077565"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Does lethality work on abilities?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Like we said earlier, lethality is just scaling armor penetration. It will work with anything that does physical damage</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1601413145166"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What counter lethality?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">When you&#8217;re facing an assassin, you should just build more armor to counter his lethality.</p> </div> </div>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Hopefully, this article clarified LoL Lethality vs Armor Pen for you, so you no longer have to wonder why that little Assassin has been one-shotting you the entire time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>League of Legends is one of the few online games that has integrated the surrender feature successfully. And yes, losing LP in a surrender game because your teammates went AFK is undoubtedly bad. But at least you have the option to do end it quickly. And with that comes the critical question:&nbsp;<strong>Do you actually lose more LP when you surrender in League of Legends? Or less?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Not too long ago, Riot Games introduced the “early surrender” option. The idea was simple: at the 15th-minute mark, a team has a chance to surrender the match over, but only if all the five teammates vote with “Yes”. And if only one person votes with “No”, the early surrender system will practically perish until the 20th minute, when the team can surrender regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of that, the LoL players have the chance to “<a href="https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/208754686--Remake-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remake</a>” the game in case a person didn’t connect at the start of the game. Practically, the remake means that if one or more of your teammates couldn’t load into the match for any reason, you and the rest of the team have 3 minutes to end the game. This only takes two people to vote or type /remake, so it’s a quick way to start a new game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both of these changes were done with one purpose in mind &#8211; dealing with the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-inting-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9523">inters</a> and the AFK players. Being in a game with a teammate who just gives up and stops playing after a few minutes is one of the most <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/why-is-league-of-legends-community-so-toxic/" data-type="post" data-id="9044">toxic</a> situations in League. And no one has fun in it!&nbsp;</p>



<p>But while the remake is essentially “free”, the early surrender system punishes you by taking exactly as much LP as a regular defeat. This received a significant negative backlash from the LoL community. And rightfully so. No one likes to lose LP when they don’t deserve it. So, Riot Games had to change things further.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The New Surrender Changes and LP Mitigation in League of Legends </strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="584" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-1024x584.png" alt="Riot Games have finally decided to proclaim a war against the toxic and inting players in League of Legends. They've recently announced a whole new system for surrender which will, hopefully, put an end on them." class="wp-image-9859" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-1024x584.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-300x171.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-768x438.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-561x320.png 561w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-1122x640.png 1122w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-364x208.png 364w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-728x415.png 728w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-608x347.png 608w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-758x432.png 758w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-1152x657.png 1152w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651-313x178.png 313w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2ltvywngyg651.jpg 1275w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>One of the most recent moves towards toxicity that Riot Games did was introducing the champion select reporting system. This feature allows players to mute and report toxic team members as soon as they meet in the champion select. And although it is a very nice change, it simply wasn’t enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But that is why Riot continued in their original path. On patch 10.22, the new measures against the inters and the AFK players took place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The changes state the players no longer have to wait 15 minutes in order to surrender a clearly lost game because of an AFK player. Instead, the new system hunts and detects when a person goes AFK, making the surrender button available automatically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you aren’t sure of what this means, let us put it this way. Let’s say you’re in a ranked game and your jungler rage quits after a while. Well, you and the rest of the team are able to surrender the game right away. But what if the jungler comes back and votes with “no”? In that case, as soon as they get detected being AFK or, you can start the surrender vote again immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to that, Riot Games will implement an LP mitigation for early surrenders in League of Legends.<strong>&nbsp;From <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/patch-10-24-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch 10.24</a>, whenever you’ll use the early surrender option, you’ll simply lose less LP.</strong>&nbsp;We still aren’t sure about how this system will work, though. The idea is that it will calculate whether you deserve to lose LP or you don’t. And based on that, it will make the judgment of how much LP you’ll lose when you surrender in LoL.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll have to see how the LP mitigation will play out on the live servers, and we’re quite curious about it. But the important thing is that we, the honest players, won’t get penalized by toxic people’s actions. We will lose less LP when we surrender, and we won’t have to grind as hard. And that has our thumbs up!&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Final Words </strong></h2>



<p>Look. No one can stop a person from <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-rage-quit-on-League-of-Legends-and-how-can-I-help-to-prevent-it?share=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rage quitting</a> in League of Legends. And quite frankly, a few people can truly calm down and not int. So, this problem has been a part of LoL since its beginning. However, as the game aged and the community grew more respective, inting and AFK have no place in League of Legends anymore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Losing less LP when surrendering and being able to quickly end a toxic game of League of Legends are fantastic features. In theory, the game should be fair to everyone and reward each person according to their efforts. We just hope that the systems work as well in practice so that we all can have a better and healthier League of Legends.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Have you ever watched or read a guide for your favorite League of Legends champion? And after the guide, you felt confident in yourself and jumped into a ranked game… only to realize that your match is completely different than what the guide said. If yes, then it’s time to meet Zar.gg!</p>



<p>But don’t worry! I’ve been in that same situation myself hundreds of times before, especially when I was still learning LoL. It’s tough to know everything that could happen with each champion in the match. And it’s challenging to actually decide the best possible outcome every time you get out of the base!</p>



<p>So how do you <em>actually use</em> the knowledge that you have for LoL? How do we maximize the potential of each tip given to us by a professional player?</p>



<p><strong>Also read: <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/most-banned-champions-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="10011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 Most Banned Champions in League of Legends</a></strong></p>



<h2><strong>What is Zar.GG?</strong></h2>



<p><a target="_blank" href="http://zar.gg" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zar.gg&nbsp;</a>is a player-friendly software that accompanies you while you’re playing League of Legends. It has a library of tips, tricks, builds, rune recommendations, and all other helpful advice. Zar.gg gives you all this information in the form of minimalistic and “out of the way” pop-up windows while you’re in the game.</p>



<p><strong><em>So how does this work in reality?</em></strong></p>



<p>Let’s say that you’re playing Katarina versus Annie in the mid lane. When Annie spends her passive stacks and has no stun for at least a few seconds, Zar.gg will give you a tip that it’s time for you to jump and trade. And when Annie has her stun available, it will tell you to be careful and not fight.</p>



<p>Although this is a simple example, Zar.gg works the same way for any champion matchup. The software always finds helpful information that you can actually use in your game and not just have the knowledge.</p>



<p>But champion matchups aren’t the only thing that Zar.gg helps you with. So let’s check how the whole app works!</p>



<h2><strong>How Does Zar.GG Help You?</strong></h2>



<p>Zar.gg does a couple of things that improve your gameplay and increase the odds of you winning. Here are the main features!</p>



<h3><strong>In-Game Tips</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="575" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-1024x575.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12486" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-1024x575.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-300x168.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-768x431.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-750x421.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips-1140x640.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/zar.gg-in-game-tips.jpeg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The in-game tips are a core feature of Zar.gg. But as I mentioned, these tips aren’t all about how to deal with your lane opponents. Instead, there are tips for everything!</p>



<p>For example, you may be playing Kha’Zix jungle. Well, Zar.gg will display appropriate information based on the champions you have on your team and the champions you’re facing against. It will tell you which lanes are the best for ganking, where you should focus, and whether it’s even worth ganking a lane!</p>



<p>Following these tips&nbsp;<em>significantly lowers</em>&nbsp;the number of mistakes you make per game. And the best part about them is that they appear in small windows. They don’t clutter your screen, and they don’t get in the way!</p>



<h3><strong>Live Dashboard</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-12487" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-1024x576.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-300x169.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-768x432.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-750x422.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard-1140x642.png 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/In-game_dashboard.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>The Live Dashboard feature appears when you press “Tab” while in the game. Normally, you only see the score table. But with Zar.gg, you also see tons of other useful information and statistics, such as:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Item recommendation &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>tell you which items will increase your power the most at any point in the game.</li><li><strong>Warding &#8211;</strong>&nbsp;informs you about the best ward spots based on your role, champion, AND current position.</li><li><strong>Other players &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>shows you which players have acquired the most amount of gold, who’s got the most items, and who’s carrying.</li><li><strong>Overall performance &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>displays info about CS/min and Vision/min about each player in the game.</li></ul>



<p>The Live Dashboard helps you understand the players in your game more and make better decisions around it.</p>



<h3><strong>Draft Advice</strong></h3>



<p>Even in champion select, Zar.gg has your back! And it’s probably one of the best features that a League software might have!</p>



<p>What does it do?</p>



<p>It gives you advice on which champion to pick, based on your history and personal playstyle. It scans the enemy team and provides you helpful information about which champion could counter them. But it also gives you statistics so you can check what your actual chance of beating that team with your champion is.</p>



<p>You can also import runes from high elo players without the need to manually set them. And you can also check the power spikes for both teams, so you know what to expect from each champion once you get into the game!</p>

<h2><strong>Why Is Zar.gg Here?</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-12490" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-300x169.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-768x432.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-750x422.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/profile-review-zar-gg.jpeg 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Well, to help you!</p>



<p>The idea behind Zar.gg is to enable you to use all the knowledge about League of Legends available on the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>High elo players have created guides that you can download on the Zar.gg anytime and load them into your games. You can try multiple different guides per champion, so you can find the one that fits your playstyle. But you can also create helpful guides yourself and publish them for other plates to use!</p>



<p><strong>Zar.gg is a tool created by League players for League players!&nbsp;</strong>It takes everything into consideration about the average LoL player and tries to help actively in the game.</p>



<p>I personally love using the software and find it extremely useful, even though I’m a Master player. It’s awesome because it reminds me of the things I should be doing in every game!</p>

<p>Riot Games released&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/lol-patch-notes/" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch 9.23</a>&nbsp;in November 2019 with many core updates and features. The pre-season update saw rebalances of elements, items and runes, skin, the fixing of client issues, and changes to champions. The patch release was the period of improvement for Riot Games as it addressed many client errors.</p>



<p>Hidden among the features was the introduction of emoticons to Riot Games, including League of Legends. This means a player could express their emotions using emojis like those supported on the smaller screen.</p>



<p>Emojis were not usable on older operating systems like Windows XP. The feature became possible with the introduction and the rise in the use of newer operating systems. Anyone can now send funny faces, kisses, smiling faces or crying, sad or angry faces.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can share your feelings and emotions easily with other gamers. All you have to do to make the emoji option pop up is to follow this simple set of instructions:</p>

<h2><strong>How to open the emoji keyboard on Windows</strong></h2>

<div class="jeg_video_container jeg_video_content"><iframe title="Emoji Keyboard in Windows 10! How to." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYqfEY4FEG8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<ul><li>Click the Windows logo key and semicolon key simultaneously to get the emoji keyboard on your screen.</li><li>Or, press the Windows logo key and full stop keys at the same time.&nbsp;</li><li>An emoji keyboard pops up on the screen.</li><li>Search through the available options and select any emoji using the arrow keys or a mouse.</li><li>Click on any emoji to enter it in the chatbox.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Use the Touch Keyboard</strong></h2>



<p>Windows 10 and 8 have the touch keyboard feature. You will find the option under the toolbar menu. Select the option and add it to your taskbar. When you need to use an emoji, you can press the smiley icon located on the lower-left portion of the on-screen keyboard. Several options will pop up with different categories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scroll through the options and select any emoji of your choice. You can add the keyboard option to your taskbar before you start gaming so that you can easily open it when you use the chatbox.</p>



<h2><strong>The Copy-Paste method</strong></h2>



<p>If you are facing difficulty opening an emoji keyboard, you can opt to copy an emoji from the internet directly and paste it into the game, and then press Enter. You can choose from a host of good emoji sites to pick the most suitable emoji to send in the client’s chat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And you can find interesting emoji options that are made explicitly for League of Legends. This method also works for those keyboards that do not have shortcut configurations.</p>



<p>You have found out how to open the emoji tab. Now, all you need to do is enter League of Legends, and when you need to chat with your fellow teammates or friends, open the chatbox, add an expressive emoji to your chat and, continue carrying on with your game.</p>

<h2><strong>Emojis- an important part of online communication</strong></h2>



<p>In 2010, developers started encoding emojis in their Unicode fonts with the release of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.0.0/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unicode version 6.0</a>. Their introduction made the chatting world a whole lot more expressive. The use of emojis on smartphones is a common scene, and their bigger counterparts are fast catching up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emojis have quickly become an integral part of the social media platform. And the gaming world of League of Legends has waited patiently enough for the inclusion of emojis in chats, though before, the emote system was already available for this gaming world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emote is also an expressive element where gamers can express their happy or angry emotions to teammates or distract opponents. Still, the traditional emoji icons were hugely wanted in the Riot Games.</p>



<p>The enabling of emojis on the client’s chat wasn’t a piece of big news at the time of the patch’s release as other major changes and fixes took the limelight. But, with the feature enabled, you can now express a whole range of emotions like you would while chatting on social media on your smartphone because, why not!&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you are gaming with all your mind in it, you would want to express your victories, your frustrations, and your appreciation. And besides, it’s a great way to boost team morale during events and leagues.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Now that you are in on the emoji feature available to clients, you can use the feature to cheer your team on, garner their interest and attention, and boost gaming experiences. Or, you can break your opponent’s concentration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Add a fun dimension to your chats with other gamers as you battle opponents, win and probably lose some matches and fight your way through tough situations.</p>



<p>Happy gaming! And, happy expressing!</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.riftherald.com/lol-patch-notes/2019/1/23/18194417/lol-patch-9-2-tldr" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch 9.2</a>&nbsp;was first released for League of Legends, a new ranking system was attached to it. It’s actually one of the most significant changes&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://egamesconsult.com/did-you-know-total-league-of-legends-player-count-updated/" rel="noreferrer noopener">LoL players</a>&nbsp;have seen in years, and it took place in 2019. With this big revamp, there were some major changes, specifically to the ranked system, which we are going to go over.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Placement Games and Provisional Rankeds</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="578" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-split-rewards-1024x578.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10532" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-split-rewards-1024x578.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-split-rewards-300x169.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-split-rewards-768x434.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-split-rewards-750x423.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-split-rewards-1140x644.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-split-rewards.jpeg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>With the addition of a provisional rank, placement games have been changed. Now, provisional ranked shows the lowest rank a player will be placed in with their current performance – these ranks aren’t going to go down, even if the player loses a match or two. However, it can increase when the player wins a match.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>There are Three Splits</strong></h2>



<p>Each season is split up into three different parts, with each one lasting around three months, without there being any breaks between. The first split, for example, ends around mid-April. Winning a ranked game will get you some Split Points. Split points aren’t going to carry over into the next split, so make sure you use them before the current split ends.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Seasonal and Split Reward</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-system-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10533" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-system-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-system-300x169.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-system-768x432.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-system-750x422.jpeg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-system-1140x641.jpeg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/lol-ranked-system.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>You can spend your split points on unique, split-specific rewards. Take Ranked Armor as an example; this is something that evolved to reflect both the player Split Point and rank achievements. Regardless of your rank, this armor can be affected and upgraded by winning matches. End-of-season rewards, on the other hand, are unaffected by Split Points.</p>



<h2><strong>Position Ranks</strong></h2>



<p>Position Ranks will give you a position-specific rank as well as a matchmaking rating. This action will help even out the ladder by acknowledging that players come in with different skill levels at different times and roles. Wins and losses can have an impact on the rank for that position, but they do bleed over into other positions, which helps entice each player to do their best when they’re playing off-roll as well as making sure their overall ranks are equivalent, so they don’t end up with a Master III mid-laner playing Jungle when they’re only in Silver II game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>New Ranks</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1000" height="217" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-ranks-in-league-of-legends.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-10534" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-ranks-in-league-of-legends.jpeg 1000w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-ranks-in-league-of-legends-300x65.jpeg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-ranks-in-league-of-legends-768x167.jpeg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-ranks-in-league-of-legends-750x163.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure></div>



<p>A couple of years ago, two new ranks were introduced – Grandmaster and Iron. Iron is the lowest tier, which is beneath Bronze, while Grandmaster can be found sitting between Master and Challenger. Each rank has now been split into a total of four divisions, down from five. These changes have been made in order to help spread the player base out so that their ranks more accurately reflect their standing as well as their skill.&nbsp;</p>
