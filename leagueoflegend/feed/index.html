										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Laning Phase is a crucial part of the game. It is a core period that will serve as a setup for future events. The chances that you’ll win the game are greatly improved by doing well during the Laning Phase, so having the best Champions for it is a bonus.</p>



<p>That is where this list comes in, and it will help you understand the key Laning aspects of a Champion. We’ve spoken about the Laning Phase in two other lists. Namely, they are the <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-laning-phase-supports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Laning Phase Supports</a> </strong>and <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-laning-phase-adcs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Laning Phase ADCs</a></strong>. </p>



<p>If you’re an avid Bot Lane player, I highly suggest you check out those two lists as they contain some helpful information about Bot Laning Phase synergies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the introduction out of the way, let us begin with the <strong>5 Best Laning Phase Mid Laners in League of Legends.</strong> (This list is in no particular order.)</p>



<h2><strong>1. Zed</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15153" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Zed is one of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/the-most-difficult-league-of-legends-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardest Champions </a>to deal with in the Lane, especially during the Assassin meta that has no end in sight. He is an energy-based Champion, meaning that he can poke and spam spells without it costing him too much. </p>



<p>The energy regenerates at a blazing fast rate, and there are even tools in his kit to speed the process up, making it abundant most of the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zed has a ton of damage. It is high right off the bat and only gets stronger as the game goes on. His passive makes him one of the most satisfying Champions to Lane and farm with. The extra damage on low-health enemies turns farming into an afterthought. You will often see Zed players with insane CS by the time mid-game rolls around because of this powerful passive.</p>



<p>He has a lot of pokes and fighting capacities and is the best Assassin in the game (and the <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-assassin-junglers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Assassin Jungler</a></strong>.) This Champion goes beyond everything you’ve ever encountered, and it is fun to see him evolve with the meta. </p>



<p>I highly recommend you get on mastering Zed right now while the LP is still free with him.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Orianna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15151" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Orianna is among my favorite Mid Laners and, indeed, my favorite Mage. She has a great Laning Phase that will see her ramp up a lot of CS and even kills during it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Orianna is a unique one because everything about her revolves around the ball she carries around. Her Q moves the thing about and serves as Orianna’s primary poke tool, together with her W.</p>



<p>&nbsp;She also has a great basic attack that does a lot of damage, allowing her to farm easily and even use it to poke a melee opponent if she happens to encounter one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her overall Laning Phase is straightforward and safe. It will revolve a lot around managing the ball’s position and poking your enemy to prepare for the level 6 all-in. After 6 you can begin roaming. Your wave clear will become a lot more powerful, allowing for often wave crashing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever your playstyle with Orianna, she’s a fantastic Champion that will only get stronger as the game goes on. In the Late Game, Orianna will become the deciding factor of team fights due to her incredible Ultimate ability, which you have to experience at least once in your life.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>3. Katarina</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15150" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Katarina is, like Zed, among the <strong>best Assassins </strong>in the game. Unlike Zed, though, she has no resource. Energy allows for a lot of ability spam, yes, but having <em>no</em> costs is a lot better, don’t you agree?</p>



<p>The sole fact that her spells cost nothing to use gives Katarina the ability to poke the enemy into oblivion right from level 1. She’ll mainly poke using her Q, a spell that becomes a real spammer during the Late Game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being a melee Champion, Katarina has a lot of dangers to face on the Mid Lane. Many Mid Lane Mages tend to be ranged, exposing Katarina to a lot of poking and harassing or even zoning if they manage to beat her at the start.</p>



<p>Katarina’s strong emphasis on roaming mitigates this, and she will be walking over to the Bot Lane before Laning has even ended. Picking up a few kills early on makes Katarina impossible to stop in the Late Game, as she has one of the strongest snowballs out there.</p>



<p>At any rate, she’s excellent on the Lane, no matter how you choose to play her. No two matches are the same, and your experience with her might differ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d still play her, though, can’t go wrong with Kata.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Vex</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15152" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Vex is the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/safest-mid-lane-picks/" data-type="post" data-id="13188">safest pick for a Mid Laner</a> in the current patch. She can farm, poke, harass and do pretty much everything from a safe distance. There is no need for Vex to get any closer than she is, making her very hard to kill. </p>



<p>Her passive fills up slowly but surely, which eventually leads to a strong poke. Playing as a melee against Vex is impossible if she does everything right. Constantly dodging and evading her attacks is complex, and she will get you low enough for a full engagement after a few strong hits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if she uses her spells too much, she’ll likely shove the Lane too far, and that’s the only downside to her playstyle. You can opt to farm with basic attacks exclusively, but you will miss out on poking the enemy laner with your otherwise powerful spells.</p>



<p>Roaming is a no-brainer with an Ultimate such as hers, and she will do it from the moment she hits level 6. The Laning Phase for Vex is just a time waste that she can’t wait to get out of, despite performing well within it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She’s a real Late Game treat that everyone hates, and you should give her a spin to hate her even more.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>5. Annie</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15149" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>As one of the oldest Champions in the game, Annie is as simple as they get. Farming with her is straightforward. Using her Q, she can guarantee a minion hit, and her mana will be refunded. Repeat this process, and boom – you have an insane CS advantage over your opponent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you stack up those 4 stacks, it’s time to divert that Q into the enemy Champion. The Q-W all-in at 4 stacks can do a ton of damage, making Annie one of the strongest level 2 all-ins. By the time you reach level 6 you’re going to be an insane burst damage caster that everyone will fear.</p>



<p>There is no player in the game that doesn’t know Annie and her bear Tibbers. I highly recommend avoiding these two when you see that purple bar filled up beneath her health bar. If she gets too close, well – let’s say you and Tibbers will be better acquainted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laning Phase, roaming, and the late game are Annie’s expertise. She can do it all and do it well, with lots of tools on her kit. I recommend trying her if you’re new to the Mid Lane, as she is very easy to play and learn.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>As I’ve said at the beginning, the Laning Phase is a crucial part of the game that can determine the outcome by itself. Though there are exceptions to this rule, they are few, and having the right Champion to win the Laning Phase is paramount. The Victory screen and that positive LP increase are all we want to see, so be sure to study these lists well to ensure your success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These lists take time and effort to make, so leave feedback to help us improve them. Keep a keen eye out on our website for more League of Legends-related content such as articles, guides, and lists.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’ve spoken previously about the <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-laning-phase-supports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Laning Phase Support Champions</a></strong> in League, so I only think it’s natural that I talk a bit about the ADCs, as well. An ADC and a Support are like bread and butter, and they scarcely can go without one another. </p>



<p>Studying these two lists will tremendously help you and your potential duo partner to create a vicious Laning Phase combo that will destroy enemies right from the get-go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ADC role is a difficult one, especially when it comes to Laning. Champions differ significantly in this regard, despite performing the same role in general. This is where the list comes in to rescue you and help you not wander around the internet trying to find a suitable pick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, without further ado, let us begin with the <strong>5 Best Laning Phase ADCs in League of Legends.</strong> (This list is in no particular order.)</p>



<h2><strong>1. Caitlyn</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15141" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Caitlyn is one of the most challenging enemies to go up against on the Lane and off of it. There are many reasons why this might be, so let’s discuss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Caitlyn has some of the most extended range in the entire game. She can safely farm from a distance and poke without breaking a sweat. Her traps and her net only help to increase said range and even amplify damage. I look at Cait as an Assassin ADC, as she has that potential to one-shot enemies and embodies the role of a hunter with her traps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With her Q, Caitlyn has a great tool to do severe damage early on. You’ll deal the total damage if you aim it correctly and hit the Champion first rather than the minions. The spell’s damage falls off if it passes through an enemy, though it does expand in width.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At any rate, Caitlyn is a safe and powerful pick that anyone can enjoy. Mastering her, however, is no easy task, and it will take a few games to get the hang of her. Once you do, though, you’re pretty much set for the rest of your ADC career, as Caitlyn never fails to be viable or strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>2. Draven</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15142" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Draven is another safe pick that, despite not having as big of a range as Caitlyn, hits as hard as a truck. He is a bit on the difficult side, and I’ve even named him one of the <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/hardest-adcs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardest ADCs</a></strong> in another list. </p>



<p>Despite that, Draven remains one of the best Laning Phase Champions and one of the rare ones where Laning is actually emphasized. You see, Draven’s passive increases whenever he kills a minion. His Axes also contribute to this whenever he catches one. Farming with his Q will quickly ramp up those Adoration stacks that will net you a lot of extra gold when you land a kill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And even if you don’t land a kill, your chances only get better as his Ultimate executes enemies that have less HP than he has stacks of Adoration. This has been the source of many memes, including Pianta’s video where he killed an enemy using only Draven’s R.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s insane how strong he can get just by farming and Laning, so you can quickly figure out why he’s on this list.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>3. Tristana</strong></h2>

<p>Tristana speaks for herself, but I’ll give some detail to her. She is one of the highest DPS ADCs in the game, at least in the early stages. At level 3, she becomes a powerhouse that can get fed in minutes when paired with the proper Support like Leona or Thresh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of this comes from Tristana’s E. It sets a bomb charge on the target enemy (yes, it is a point and click) that ticks and explodes, doing AOE damage. Tristana can attack the charged enemy, which will increase the spell’s damage substantially. If she hits the enemy 4 times, the charge will deal 120% extra damage and explode immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At level 3, when both Tristana and her Support have 3 spells available, they can simply CC the enemy, and Tristana’s charge will do the rest. At that low of a level and during the remainder of the Laning Phase, Tristana’s charge can more or less one-shot enemies.</p>



<p>If she gets those 4 hits off, it’s game over, making her one of the hardest Laning Phase ADCs to deal with. As I’ve said, she synergizes best with the likes of Leona and Thresh, both of whom were in our <strong>best Laning Phase Supports</strong> list.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Ashe</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15140" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Ashe, like the first two on the list, is a safe pick. She can farm easily, and it is pretty satisfying to use her basic attacks. They are nicely animated and provide for a fun experience just farming about the Lane.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a distance, she can poke the enemies with her W, and if she feels extra spicy, fighting is the name of the game. But most of the time, she’ll safely farm using either her basic attacks or her W, with the occasional Q toggle to shove the minion waves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If she gets dragged into a fight, the Q mentioned above is an all-powerful spell that will obliterate squishy health bars right off the bat. As the game progresses, this only gets worse (or better), making Ashe a solid mid-game solution to the ADC role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her Ultimate is a global spell that allows her to remain present on other parts of the map while still in the Laning Phase. Though it is a skill shot and tends to be difficult to use from a distance, it is certainly nice to have, and landing it will substantially help your allies across the map.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She’s simple, one of the old ones and a fun pick to play both on and off the Lane, and I’d highly recommend you take her for a spin.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>5. Miss fortune</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15144" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Miss Fortune, everyone’s favorite pirate hunter. Well, if you’re not a Gangplank main, that is (like myself). There’s scarcely a Champion that’s easier to farm with than Miss Fortune, and her passive explains it all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You get extra damage on the first hit against an enemy. It’s that simple. She can use this to ensure a 100% execution on every minion, even if she misses that near-death mark. Farming is satisfying with MF, and if the enemy happens to stay behind a minion – well, you’ve got a solution for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her Q goes through the first enemy hit and jumps to any enemy standing too close. This second shot does a lot more damage as well, meaning that it’s a fantastic poke ability. It helps MF zone the enemies greatly and poking with her Q, basic, and E is straightforward. These 3 abilities combined will drive your opponents crazy, and they won’t even be able to catch you because of your excellent W.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It gives MF movement speed, nicely increasing her mobility (which he dramatically lacks). Her Ultimate makes MF one of the best team fighters in the game, and she is undoubtedly one of the better picks to have in your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone loves Sarah, and I believe you’ll have just as much fun if you give her a try.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The Laning Phase is one of the most critical parts of a League of Legends match. It serves to set up everything that happens later on, though that can change on a whim based on some other factors. At any rate, if you win the Laning Phase, chances are you’ll win the game, too – and having the right tool for the job is always better than arriving unprepared.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In League of Legends, there are various types of damage done over time. There’s burning, leeching, Death’s Dance proccing, etc. Among these also counts poisoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Poison in League of Legends is a damage source available to a minimal number of Champions. Four, to be precise. We will cover all four of them in this list, as it wouldn’t make much sense to exclude anyone from it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since there are only four, I can detail them and their mechanics other than the poison abilities. They vary largely between each other and are played in all roles in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to their inherent differences in playstyle, I will refrain from numbering this list and name them, go over their strengths and weaknesses, and you be the judge of the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No Champion on this list is inherently better than the other. The situations vary, and your experience will be different in each game you play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with that out of the way, let us begin with the <strong>Best Poison Champions in League of Legends.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Cassiopeia</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15100" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Out of all the Champions named in this list, Cass has perhaps the most extensive reliance on poison in her kit. Everything revolves around poison with her spells, save for her Ultimate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Embodying her snake form, Cass’ Q and W are poisoning abilities from which her E scales incredibly. She’s more or less a straightforward Champion, and thus her Q is an uncomplicated blast of poisonous cloud, and her W covers the ground with poison goo. While standing in her W, Champions are grounded, meaning they can’t Flash, dash, jump, or do anything of the sort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the game progresses, her poison can get lethal. This is especially the case when combined with items like Liandry’s that will chunk any Champion’s HP hard with the press of a button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This brings me to her E. If the target is poisoned, Cassiopeia’s E will deal bonus damage and heal her. In the late game, this 0.75s cooldown spell becomes a rapid-firing poison barrage that no one can escape from. Simply use your Q to poison the enemies and your W to keep them in place, and follow up with a machine gun of venomous fangs to bring the enemy to heel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cassiopeia is an interesting Champion, all things considered. She doesn’t buy boots but gets passive movement speed. Riot explained this with her lack of feet, and I mean – it does make sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This allows Cass to have an extra free item slot to replace the boots, giving her a massive advantage over most other Champions that can only have up to 5 items in their inventory. That is, if they want to keep their movement speed and not trade it for an item.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She has a sky<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/10-highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">-high skill cap</a>, and it will take you a lot of games to learn her otherwise brutal combos. Taking your time to master her will pay off, however, and will lead you to an LP increase in no time. </p>

<h2><strong>2. Teemo</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15102" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Teemo is a poisonous little scumbag that everyone hates to see in their games. He is also one of the best Top Laners in the current meta, enjoying an almost permanent S+ tier ranking on u.gg. With a win rate of over 52%, he remains a proper bastard, so let’s talk about him for a little bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teemo’s poison is attached to both his E and his Ultimate. Though I’d said that Cass is the only one whose whole kit revolves around poison, Teemo is a close second. He is a Champion that relies a little bit too much on damage over time and his Mushrooms. The Mushroom placement can easily highlight the difference between a good and a bad Teemo player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the early game, Teemo will use his poison to poke and harass the hell out of the enemy Laner. As most Top Lane Champions will be melee, Teemo has almost no counterplay and can have a field day with any opponent he encounters. His shrooms at level 6 will serve as glorified wards and a way to do extra damage during 1v1 fights within large minion waves.</p>



<p>As the game progresses, he will gradually lose his reliance on auto attacks and focus a lot more on his shroom placement. Planting shrooms around chokepoints is crucial to maintain the enemy’s heightened sense of danger. They will always tread lightly and carefully around each narrow pathway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will significantly help deter enemies trying to approach your team during objective taking like Drake and Baron. Remember that enemies can easily detect your Mushrooms by using the Sweeping Lens trinket or with Control Wards. They will immediately focus on using these two tools, so be sure to place shrooms at <em>very</em> unexpected spots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teemo is a god currently and is incredibly easy to play, learn and master. I highly recommend you play him, though if you’re on EUNE, I will gladly ban it to prevent you from doing so.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Twitch</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15103" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Twitch is the <em>least</em> poisonous of all the Champions listed here. Though he constantly poisons his enemies with his basic attacks and W, he does very little poison damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twitch has a poison attacked to his passive that deals true damage, rather than magic like the rest of the entries on this list. At level 18 and max stacks, this spell can deal 30 true damage per second. It also scales off of AP slightly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That may seem a lot, and I know I’ve said that Twitch does very little poison damage. Early in the game, he will struggle to maintain anything over 2 to 3 stacks which will deal about 5-6 true damage per second. That amount is easily mitigated if the enemy has an Enchanting Support, a shield, or other healing sources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the late game, his reliance on the poison diminishes greatly, and he will turn into your run-of-the-mill ADC like any other. The importance of his poison is executing low HP enemies using his E, which does damage based on the number of passive stacks Twitch has on an enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is his primary use for the poison and not the poison itself. It is a finishing touch that will help Twitch end the opponents before they manage to escape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twitch is an ADC, as indicated. Learning any ADC will take time, and it is a unique way of playing the game altogether. Positioning, farming, and other mechanics must be deeply studied and learned by heart before any significant step in progressing with a Champion is made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you do master these mechanics, though, no other role in the game will seem difficult, at least in terms of Laning. You’ll have to figure everything else by yourself as it will heavily rely on your general learning ability and how well you grasp new things in this game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, no one truly <em>learns</em> League entirely as it is an ever-changing environment, and you never know what’s waiting in the next patch.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>4. Singed</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15101" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Singed is a Top Laner. That’s all I have to say about him. He can be played elsewhere, but Top is his home, and he’s there to say, and I mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His poison comes from his insane Q that, when activated, leaves behind him a trail of smoke that will poison anyone that walks through it. It is a toggle spell, meaning Singed can turn it on and off at will. While active, it will slowly drain his mana and automatically deactivate when he runs out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singed’s entire playstyle is centered around this spell. Most players will use it to proxy farm waves behind the enemy’s tower, piling up a massive amount of solo gold and XP over time. He can rarely be stopped, as he has a lot of tools to escape and fight if the need arises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His W and E are both crowd control spells that can stun enemies for a solid amount if used correctly. Even when used separately, these spells are pretty powerful. The W acts similarly to Cass’ Miasma, which grounds people are highly slowed to the point of a stun being preferable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The E lunges enemies behind Singed. It allows him to use his Ultimate to boost movement speed, run into the enemies, and fling one into his team for quick execution. There’s an infinite amount of things to do with Singed once you’ve mastered him, though I wouldn’t recommend doing so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You see, Singed is a very niche character to play as and has one of the lowest player counts of all Champions in the game. He’s just bad most of the time, and there are scarcely capable hands that can use him correctly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At any rate, you can try him if you want. I wouldn’t, but I’m not your dad.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>As we can see, poison mechanics can be found in every type of Champion you can think of. From the casting Mage Cassiopeia to the tanky moron Singed. Though limited to only this tiny pool of Champions, poison is no joke when found on an overfed player.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gaming laptops are often the peak of laptop performance. They offer desktop PC-like specs (or sometimes even better than desktop PCs), in a compact package that comes at a competitive price. Gaming laptops can provide the user with a device with a sturdy build quality, great battery life, and amazing performance. Another thing that gaming laptops are known for are their designs. Generally, gaming laptops are characterized by their bold, flashy, and colorful designs. With LED RGB back-lit keyboards and shells that will remind you of alien spaceships (looking at you Alienware), gaming laptops are certainly not afraid to stand out amongst the crowd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, let’s just say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Expanding on that, we’re not really sure if all beholders find the “exciting” designs of gaming laptops desirable. Maybe they want something understated, mature. Something they can bring into conference rooms without raising everyone’s eyebrows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, at the same time, they can’t compromise on performance and specs. If you’re one of those people and you’ve found yourself in this conundrum, this article will surely help you out.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>In a hurry? Here are our top 3 picks for the best gaming laptop that doesn&#8217;t look like gaming laptops!</em></strong></p>

This comparison works if we compare them on a technical level. Gaming laptops are designed to handle heavy and demanding tasks, they perform better and are more suited to manage large loads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaming laptops’ CPUs (Central Processing Units) and GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are specially designed and developed to take on heavy gaming and due to this, they can also handle CPU/GPU intensive tasks such as software development, 3D animation, graphic design, video editing, photo editing, etc. No matter what requirement you have, gaming laptops can meet your needs and they can do it effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there are a couple of caveats to gaming laptops. These are their battery life and cost. Gaming laptops are notorious for getting low battery life and not lasting throughout the day. Regular laptops built for office/college use tend to last longer because they don’t have the high-end components that drain battery life quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next problem with gaming laptops is that they are usually priced very high. Paying a high price for a heavy-duty laptop doesn’t make sense if you don’t really need the fancy spec sheet. If all you require is a laptop that you can use MS office on, browse with or watch movies on, you’re better off with choosing a normal laptop that will not only come at a lower price, but will get you longer battery life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s go through some standard comparisons between gaming laptops and normal laptops. Gaming laptops are high-performance machines with large amounts of RAM and dedicated graphics cards that can handle heavy-duty work. On the other hand, normal laptops have processors that are made to work with basic and low-intensity tasks. Normal laptops also tend to use integrated graphics cards which don’t offer much in terms of graphics capabilities. The displays and speakers that gaming laptops come with are advanced and impressive. </p>



<p>Gaming laptops display crisp (sometimes 4K) images at a high refresh rate and the sound from their speakers goes up to high volumes without losing its quality. Whereas, with normal laptops, you get standard refresh rates and speakers. However, there are some normal laptops at higher price points that do feature high-quality sound and picture quality.</p>



<h2><strong>Are Gaming Laptops Good for Daily Use?</strong></h2>



<p>The answer to this question really comes down to your personal requirements. Gaming laptops can obviously easily handle any everyday task you throw at them, so that shouldn’t be much of a problem. I mean, if a laptop can handle Cyberpunk at 60fps, I’m pretty sure it can also handle watching Netflix and taking notes. The only problems you’re likely to face are portability and battery life. </p>



<p>Gaming laptops are notorious for being heavy and not lasting long enough. However, the laptops on this list are pretty light and slim, which will help with portability. Coming to the battery issue, as long as you’re not putting the laptop under a lot of load, the battery should last longer than it would while playing games. You could also carry around a spare battery to swap out whenever the first one runs out!</p>



<h2><strong>Reviewing The Top 7 Gaming Laptops</strong></h2>

<p>Kicking off the list, we have the Razer Blade 15 Advanced Gaming Laptop (2021). This is an update to last year’s Razer Blade 15 and has quite some improvements to take note of. We have chosen this laptop to be our best overall choice among all the laptops in this list. The reasons behind this decision become clear once you look at its configurations and details.</p>



<h3><strong>Specs</strong></h3>



<ul><li>RAM: (Up to) 32GB DDR4-2933MHz 16GBx2</li><li>Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080</li><li>Display: 15 Inch FHD 360Hz or QHD 240Hz or 4K</li><li>Storage: 1TB PCIe NVMe</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Why is this the best gaming laptop that doesn’t look like a gaming laptop?</strong></h3>



<p>If you have any doubts as to why we’ve chosen the Razer Blade 15 Advanced 2021 as our top pick, allow me to clear it up for you. For starters, the Razer Blade 15 Advanced 2021 ticks off our one main requirement. The laptop can’t look like a gaming laptop. Well, be rest assured, as this laptop certainly doesn’t look like a gaming laptop and goes for a low-key, understated design with a matte black exterior and the Razer logo proudly displayed on the back.</p>



<p>Apart from fulfilling our primary requirement, the laptop is also well specced and built to last. Despite being thin and light (for a gaming laptop), it consists of all the ports you could need, along with a Kensington lock. The full-size SD card reader in the laptop is another solid addition to the already attractive package. The laptop’s display is magnificent and the bezels on the sides are quite thin as well. All of these reasons, and many more, make the Razer Blade 15 Advanced 2021, our top pick for a gaming laptop that doesn’t look like a gaming laptop.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Gaming Laptop That Doesn’t Look Like a Gaming Laptop?</strong></h2>



<p>To help you choose the best gaming laptop that doesn&#8217;t look like a gaming laptop, we’ve listed down some key points to go over while making your choice. Keep in mind that each point is subjective and how you see it should depend on your personal use and requirements and not what is considered to be good.</p>



<h3><strong>Design</strong></h3>



<p>As we’re looking for gaming laptops that don’t look like gaming laptops, the design should be a major priority. Try to stay away from flashy colors, lots of RGB, or crazy cuts, lines, and creases.</p>



<h3><strong>Processors</strong></h3>



<p>The processor, or the CPU, of your laptop is the main engine that will help you drive it. Getting the latest generation processors is a good idea as it will make sure that your laptop remains useful for the coming years and doesn’t become obsolete. As a minimum, look for an Intel Core i5-3570K or better in terms of CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 or AMD Radeon R9 290X or better in terms of a GPU. Anything lower would just not work in today’s time.</p>



<h3><strong>Portability</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re planning on using your laptop on the go, then make sure that it is light and comes with sufficient battery life. A weight of around 2.5-3 kgs and battery life of at least 4-5 hours are good expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>RAM and Storage</strong></h3>



<p>In terms of RAM, buying a laptop with less than 8GB of RAM would be redundant in 2022 and you should preferably get one with 16 gigs of RAM. 512 GB of SSD storage should be the starting point for storage.</p>



<h3><strong>Ports &amp; Other Hardware</strong></h3>



<p>Look for HDMI ports, Thunderbolt 3 or 4, at least 1 USB type C port, 2 USB Type-A ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, an ethernet port, and a full-size SD card reader on your next laptop. As for hardware, get a feel of the laptop to ensure that it is sturdy and has a high-quality keyboard and speakers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>To sum up, there are plenty of options available for people who want a gaming laptop but don’t want the design of one.</p>



<p>The Razer Blade 15 Advanced is currently the best overall pick for a gaming laptop that doesn’t look like a laptop due to its design, performance, and high quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using the following parameters will help you choose a gaming laptop that meets your needs:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the crazy potential to get out of hand during team fights to solo kills in lane, Katarina is one of the most mobile assassins that can feel unbeatable if handled poorly. Her roaming potential to snipe pushed bot or top lane gives her a chance to start <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-snowballing-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="10383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowballing</a>, but as always, there is the rock to the scissors, and Katarina has weaknesses that you can take advantage of.</p>



<h2><strong>Katarina’s Abilities</strong></h2>



<p>Katarina&#8217;s kit is based mainly on reducing CDs of her abilities. To better understand how to avoid mistakes when dealing with her, you have to dive into her abilities and, most importantly, her passive.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Passive &#8211; Voracity: </strong>Whenever an enemy champion dies that Katarina has damaged recently, her remaining ability cooldowns are dramatically reduced. This is the bread and butter of crazy potential to get out of hand in every team fight. If Katarina picks up a Dagger, she uses it to slash through all nearby enemies, dealing magic damage. It synergizes with her Q and W, which both leave a dagger on the ground that she can pick up to deal AOE damage.</li><li><strong>Q &#8211; Bouncing Blade: </strong>She throws a dagger, which bounces from enemy to enemy before ricocheting on the ground. It can hit minions and champions as well.</li><li><strong>W &#8211; Preparation: </strong>She gains a burst of movement speed and leaves a dagger behind her.</li><li><strong>E &#8211; Shunpo: </strong>She can use E to blink to a target&#8217;s location. It can be an enemy, an ally, or her dagger from Q or W.</li><li><strong>R &#8211; Death Lotus:</strong> She starts to channel for up to 2,5 seconds, during which she throws daggers around her to up to 3 enemies. During this time, she is applying Grievous Wounds as well as AOE damage.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Countering Katarina&#8217;s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>The biggest counter to Katarina is <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard CC</a> (stuns, silences, knock-ups, displacements). Roots are not that useful. Zhonya&#8217;s Hourglass active or Guardian Angel can be very handy as well. Katarina will try to use her daggers on the ground to deal unexpected damage to you. If you see a dagger, your best bet is to stay away from it so she can not deal free damage to you. On the other hand, you can bait her E on a dagger when there is your jungler in a bush waiting to help you out.</p>

<h2><strong>Most Common Katarina Combos</strong></h2>



<p>In the laning phase, E-W-AA-picking up the dagger-Q-AA-E-picking up the dagger or Q-E-picking up the dagger-AA-W combos are used for trading with the enemies. During the early game, Katarina players use W-Q-E when the enemy is under the tower. They prepare W outside tower range, run at the enemy, throw a Q and E out.</p>



<p>All combos rely heavily on Katarina’s condition to get near the enemy and even AA to deal a significant amount of damage (except for her Q that can be used as a poke).</p>



<p>The most important thing to keep an eye on are daggers on the ground and the recent use of her E. Without her E, she is vulnerable to ganks from your jungler.</p>

<h2><strong>Katarina&#8217;s Weaknesses</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. CC</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>, CC, and CC. Katarina uses her mobility to get in and out of team fights, but if your team is able to lock her down during the dive to your <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/most-squishy-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="13284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy</a> back lane, you may be able to kill her first. If you see that the enemy has already picked Katarina, try to encourage your teammates to pick champions that have CC.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Vision</strong></h3>



<p>CC. Did we mention CC already? Oh yea, we did. Jokes aside, vision is another great protection layer that you can put between you and Katarina. Well placed ward can spot her coming to your lane and you will be aware that you should keep back or even try to cooperate with other teammates to catch her off guard.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Runes optimization</strong></h3>



<p>Taking magic resistance runes will mitigate most of her damage. She does physical damage as well, but magic damage is her main output.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>4. Slow and steady</strong></h3>



<p>Try not to die early, wait for your junglers help, or play passively if you struggle against her in the early game. If you have good push potential, try to clear minions. Katarina is weak at farming under the tower.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>5. Range advantage</strong></h3>



<p>Use your range to your advantage. As we stated before, she relies on her daggers and gets close enough to you to deal a significant amount of damage.</p>



<h3><strong>6. Let others know</strong></h3>



<p>Use pings to warn your teammates that she is missing. An obvious tip, but it never hurts to remind you about the possibility of using pinging as a helpful way to communicate with other teammates.</p>



<h2><strong>The Best Katarina Lane Counters in Season 12</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Irelia</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15061" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Irelia is one of the most versatile and definitely strongest lane counters that you can pick against Katarina. With the gold difference of +430 gold at the 15th-minute mark, Irelia is the champion that stomps Katarina into the ground.</p>



<p>The most optimal way to win your lane as Irelia against Katarina is to play it safe until you hit level 3. If you, unfortunately, die to Katarina, she might be able to snowball from early lead to unstoppable force to the end of the match. After you survive the first three levels and buy your first items, you will be able to push Katarina under her turret, where she will be unable to farm efficiently.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Zed</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15063" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Zed is another excellent champion to deal with Katarina. With the gold difference of +410 gold at the 15th-minute mark, Zed is another great pick that deals with Katarina very well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again the most optimal way in this matchup is to wait for his level 3 and play it safe. His Q allows him to trade, poke and farm using range to your advantage. You can even dodge part of Katarina’s combo by his R, during which he is untargetable.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Honorable mention: Tryndamere</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15062" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Tryndamere’s R basically denies Katarina’s reset potential and thus making her obviously desperate. His built-in healing with Q helps him with poke and chasing potential with E allows him to react to Katarina’s E.</p>

<h2><strong>The Best Champions to Counter Katarina in Season 12</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Kayle</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15059" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Kayle’s R directly counters Katarina. Well-timed R to your squishy carry (Kayle as well) can turn around fight where Katarina is trying to get reset with a kill. Her range helps to deal with Katarina as well. Kayle is a scaling champion, so you have to keep that in mind. Pre 6 Kayle is unable to beat Katarina in any way.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Vladimir</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15060" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Vladimir’s pool, aka W, is another annoying (read as great to counter) ability to save Vladimir from Katarina’s combos. His build-in beefiness through his passive and natural healing with Q makes him harder to deal with for all Katarina players (remember that Katarina’s R applies Grievous Wounds).</p>



<h3><strong>3. Kassadin</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15058" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Kassadin’s R is one of the best mobility spells in LoL. If Katarina decides to jump on you, you can quickly blink away with your R. Other reasons are that Kassadin’s passive makes him take less damage from magic, and his Q can interrupt Katarina’s R.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Katarina is tough to master champion with huge skill dependency. Her combos are very complicated, and you will be happy to see her in your team if the player mastered her to every detail. On the other hand, you will feel desperate if you hear the announcer scream Penta kill! after the team fight. But after reading our guide on how to counter her, we are sure that you will be able to win against her easily and abuse her weaknesses even further than before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pick a champion within our recommended counters that you are most familiar with and feel most comfortable playing with. If you did not find any of your favorite champions from our list, try to pick something that has reliable CC. Try to save it for her and lead your team to a victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When playing a video game like League of Legends, precision is everything, especially if you want to land those crucial skill shots. For this reason, I recommend adjusting your settings in a way that is just for you, allowing you the opportunity to use your mouse to its utmost potential.</p>



<p>This is rare, but there are some patches that cause those in-game settings, such as your mouse sensitivity, to reset without any warning. When this happens to you for the first time, it’s going to catch you off guard. You could end up stuck with a slow cursor so it may take you some time to fix the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re like many gamers, you may rely on your Windows’ cursor settings, and there is nothing wrong with this – you will need to tab out of the match so that you can fi it. Via the in-game settings, you’ll be able to get up to speed, so no worries there. </p>



<p>When that cursor speed drops in League of Legends, it can be downright frustrating. I’m going to save you from those frustrating moments – here’s what you can do in order to fix the dropping cursor speed in League of Legends:</p>

<h2><strong>Look at Your Windows Cursor Settings</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15054" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-1024x576.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-300x169.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-768x432.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-1536x864.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-150x84.png 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-750x422.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-1140x641.png 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>First things first, you’re going to want to head over to your windows cursor settings and check that out.</p>



<p>A good amount of LoL player base doesn’t change any of their sensitivity settings through League’s in-game menus, and that is understandable. They choose to keep everything at their default values, and when you choose to do this, League if going to automatically go to your default Windows configurations and fetch the settings from there.</p>



<p>Whenever a patch comes out that manages to reset your cursor settings, you will need to go in there and adjust your cursor settings back to where you had them.</p>



<p><em>If you’re using Windows 10, here are some steps for you to follow:</em></p>



<ul><li>Open the Start Panel on Windows and type “Mouse.”</li><li>From there, click on “Mouse Settings,” and select “Additional mouse options.”</li><li>After you have done this, a tiny interface will pop up in front of you and during this time, you will need to navigate to “Pointer Options.”</li><li>You may notice the adjuster has been placed back in the middle, and you will need to slide it to where it originally was in order to fix your sensitivity in League of Legends.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Fix Your League sensitivity Through Options</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="574" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-1024x574.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15053" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-1024x574.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-300x168.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-768x430.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-750x420.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-1140x639.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Okay, so you have adjusted your league sensitivity through the game’s settings. You will now need to make those same adjustments to fix your sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Follow these steps:</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>If you’re in a match, you can press “ESC,” which will bring up the options menu, or click on the cog icon that can be found at the top right corner of your screen.&nbsp;</li><li>Click on “Game” and start adjusting your “Mouse Speed” to the previous value.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>If you don’t remember what your mouse speed was, then you will need to experiment until you find the sped that fits your playstyle.</p>



<h2><strong>Advice to Help You Remember Your Settings</strong></h2>



<p>The error rarely ever happens, but when it does, it can be frustrating, and it’s even more frustrating when you can’t remember what your previous settings were. For this reason, I recommend taking a screenshot of your Windows sensitivity options, along with your in-game configurations as this can help you recover those settings right away.</p>



<h3><strong>Fixing Windows 10 Mouse Lag</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>In Windows 10, mouse lag can be very annoying, especially when you’re playing League of Legends. Not only does Windows 10 mouse lag slow down your productivity and lead to mistakes while you’re trying to create documents, it can also interfere with gameplay.</p>



<p>Some people can go years without realizing they’re dealing with mouse lag, but there are scenarios where mouse lag can become noticeable.</p>



<h4><strong>Common Scenarios Where Mouse Lag is Noticeable:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>While Playing Games – The most common scenario where you’ll notice mouse lag is while playing games – the game stop responding to your mouse movements, and this can be very frustrating.</li><li>Word Document – While you’re scrolling down a Word document and the scroll bar continue to pause, even when you’re scrolling.&nbsp;</li><li>Multiple Clicks – Your computer isn’t responding to the mouse clicks, so you have to click on one application two or more times.</li></ul>



<p>This form of mouse lag can happen when you have a lot of programs/apps running on your computer at one time. So, before attempting the troubleshooting tips I’m about to give you, first make sure you have all apps closed.</p>

<h2><strong>The Cause of Mouse Lag on Windows 10</strong></h2>



<p>Mouse lag just so happens to be one of the most common issues Windows 10 users face. This is because there are actually numerous reasons as to why a mouse could be lagging. It could be anything from misconfigured mouse setting, a recent driver update, or a bad wireless mouse battery causing the lag.</p>



<p>The fastest way to get you back on your feet and eliminate that lag so that you can play League of Legends (mouse lag-free) would be to start by taking a look at the hardware itself (that’s the mouse). From there, work your way through the components and applications that work together to make your muse function as it should.</p>



<p>Look at Your Mouse First – If you have a wireless mouse, you should put new batteries in. If you have a wired mouse, try unplugging it from your computer and plugging it back in. By doing this, you will be restarting your driver and hopefully, this will have the mouse working properly.</p>



<p><em><strong>Still having issues with the mouse lag? Here are a couple of tricks which may be of help to you:</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Clean the Wireless Mouse</strong> – If you notice the lag happening in spurts or if the lag is intermittent, this could be because there is dirt covering the IR sensor that is under the mouse. If the mouse scrolling is lagging, this could be because there is dirt stuck in the scroll wheel of the mouse. Try cleaning the mouse (a q-tip should work).</p>



<p><strong>Test the Mouse</strong> – You should test the mouse on another computer so you can be certain it’s the mouse. If you don’t have another computer, try using it with your PS4, Xbox, or iPad. If you discover the mouse works fine on another device, but it doesn’t do so hot on your Windows 10 computer, then you now know that the problem is with your computer and not your mouse. </p>



<p><strong>Different USB Port </strong>– Take the mouse and plug it into a different USB port on your computer. More specifically, if you were originally plugged into a USB 3.0 port on your computer, switch it to a USB 2.0 port.&nbsp; If you discover it’s the USB port the mouse was originally plugged into, then you will need to troubleshoot that particular USB port itself.</p>



<p><strong>Fast Startup</strong> – Fast startup can also have an impact on your mouse. Many people love this Windows 10 feature as it quickly starts the computer. However, it can cause mouse lag, so if you are experiencing mouse lag, try disabling fast startup, restarting your computer, and see if that gets rid of the lag.</p>



<p>Power Saving Mode – Windows Power Saving Mode can also have an effect on mouse behavior.  If you’re using a laptop that is not plugged in, then Windows may try to turn off the USB port in order to conserve power. So go ahead and Disable Power Saving Mode and see if this fixed the mouse lag issue you’re having.</p>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>If you’re still experiencing mouse lag while playing League of Legends, try uninstalling the 3<sup>rd</sup> party gaming software that came with the mouse. There are a variety of gaming peripherals that are used to play LoL, but they don’t control the development of software that comes with it. If you’re experiencing mouse lag in League of Legends with a custom mouse (or even a custom keyboard) and you’re running 3<sup>rd</sup> party software that controls them, you may want to uninstall the software and see if the issue stops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Communication is crucial in first-person shooters like Valorant, and you can see in the myriad of ways you can communicate with your teammates. Party chat, team chat, and even team voice chat are all proper channels to message your team about necessary information to win the match.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if you feel this playful need to trash talk or randomly hit up someone on the enemy side, Valorant also has your back. You can access all chat where everyone in the match, including the enemy team, can see and read.</p>



<h2><strong>Typing to All Players in Valorant</strong></h2>



<p>There are two ways to send a message to all chat. The most convenient way is to press Shift+Enter, which will prefix “/all ” immediately, then you can type your message after it. Pressing Enter again will send the message to all chat; you can tell by looking at the chatbox and seeing if it has “(All)” before your message.</p>



<p>Another way to send a message to all chat is to press Enter and manually type “/all “ before your message. Don’t forget the space after the “/all” or the game won’t send the message to all chat.</p>



<p>Now, you’re ready to send your well-wishes, trash talk, or try your luck to scout a better teammate from the enemy team!</p>

<h2><strong>What is Butterfly Clicking?</strong></h2>



<p>Have you noticed that when a person&#8217;s hand lifts or moves off a mouse, it loses contact with the desk, which changes the input? Moving your hands slightly up and down in a fast motion allows for more accurate clicking since your hand is constantly in contact with the desk.</p>



<p>Butterfly clicking, otherwise known as &#8220;tweaking,&#8221; is a technique used by many gamers to have an advantage at their favorite games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this technique, gamers can play faster and more precisely because they don&#8217;t have to worry about lifting their hands from the mouse pad to click on items on-screen, the same goes for keyboard chords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some players find butterfly clicking just feels better since they&#8217;re not held back by drag from their palms being pressed against a mousepad or other surface.</p>



<h2><strong>Is Butterfly Clicking Allowed?</strong></h2>



<p>Go to any competitive game, and you&#8217;ll see the pros using butterfly clicking. But what about those who play for fun? The answer is &#8211; it&#8217;s up to you! To be clear, there isn&#8217;t a rule that says that butterfly clicking is forbidden, but some gaming companies prohibit their players from doing it.</p>



<p>If an online game has its own rules against this technique, it&#8217;s best not to do it; your account may get banned if anyone reports your activity as cheating. The mouse manufacturers themselves also sometimes will put out statements forbidding players from using this or other styles of clicks too.</p>



<p>However, if there are no specific policies banning butterfly clicking for the games you enjoy playing offline or online, then yes&#8211;you can use this technique to your advantage! It is perfectly acceptable and encouraged.</p>

<p>Razer is a name associated with high-end computers and other devices, such as mice. The Razer Naga Trinity is one of the best mice on the market, featuring three detachable side plates that have two, seven, and twelve buttons, respectively.</p>



<p>It also boasts a staggering 19 programmable buttons, allowing you to remap and apply complex macro functions to meet your unique gaming needs. Use a lot of hotkeys? This mouse is for you. Otherwise, you can simply use the basic two-button plate when you need something simple.</p>



<p>The mechanical buttons of the Razer&nbsp; Trinity can withstand up to 50 million clicks, making it a suitable mouse for butterfly clicking.</p>



<p>Above all, its buttons provide audible feedback to confirm that the click has been detected while also preventing accidental clicks.</p>



<p>These buttons may be changed using the Razer Synapse software to allow for more personalized usage. As a result, it&#8217;s safe to say that the Razer Naga Trinity is the most popular butterfly mouse.</p>



<h3><strong>Why Is This the Best Gaming Mouse for Butterfly Clicking in 2022?</strong></h3>



<p>While it seems to be a simple mouse, the Razer Naga Trinity offers a lot more than you may think. It offers Chroma RGB Color Profiles that are subtle and adaptable. It is also very convenient to use because of the small, tactile bumps that make it easier to grip and make scrolling easier in high-stakes games. It features long-lasting mechanical switches that can withstand up to 50 million clicks.</p>

<p>Glorious’ Model O is remarkable because of its high performance and low weight build. The honeycomb shape of this mouse allowed for the low weight (66g) without sacrificing durability. The holes provide ventilation, although you won&#8217;t feel them while playing.</p>

<p>The Glorious Model O has a maximum DPI of 12,000, allowing for pixel-perfect tracking while gaming. It comes with eight different RGB color effects, allowing you to personalize the mouse to match your setup theme.</p>



<p>The Omron mechanical switches ensure that the mouse can withstand up to 20 million clicks without fail. The mouse also has six responsive programmable buttons that may be remapped to your needs.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Mouse for Butterfly Clicking?</strong></h2>



<p>When looking for a mouse to use for butterfly clicking, there are a few things you should consider. The following are some of the most important factors to think about when making your decision:</p>



<h3><strong>Ergonomics</strong></h3>



<p>When it comes to gaming mice, you want one that feels comfortable in your hand. You&#8217;ll be using it for long periods of time, so it&#8217;s important that it&#8217;s not only physically comfortable but also fits your grip well. Some mice have different ergonomic designs, so be sure to choose one that feels best for you.</p>



<h3><strong>Sensor Type</strong></h3>



<p>The sensor type is important because it affects how precise your mouse will be. Optical sensors are the most popular type and are very accurate, while laser sensors are the most efficient. Make sure that there are specific drivers for your mouse if you want to change how it works, but in most cases, the defaults should suffice.</p>



<h3><strong>Adjustable DPI Settings</strong></h3>



<p>Make sure that you choose a mouse that has adjustable DPI settings to allow for more precise movements during gameplay. This is especially important for butterfly clickers since they want as many accurate clicks per minute as possible! Don&#8217;t rely on your mouse&#8217;s default settings if you plan on using this technique.</p>



<h3><strong>Programmable Buttons &amp; Macros</strong></h3>



<p>Programmable buttons and macros are a plus but not necessary for success in the gaming world. If you personally find these features useful, make sure your mouse has them. However, if you prefer simplicity, there are plenty of mice out there without these extra settings that can still do a great job!</p>



<h3><strong>Comfort</strong></h3>



<p>Comfort is extremely important when playing games for long periods of time or competitively since you need to be able to feel confident in knowing that your hand will feel good even after hours of playtime&#8211;and it should certainly look good too! So remember, the best mouse for butterfly clicking is one that feels good in your hand and makes you want to game more!</p>



<h3><strong>Price</strong></h3>



<p>You don&#8217;t necessarily need to spend a fortune on a mouse that can cater to your butterfly clicking desires. It&#8217;s good to try and find the perfect balance between price and quality, so do what you can without breaking the bank! Some of the best gaming mice out there are quite affordable&#8211;and if you&#8217;re just looking for something simple as a backup or as a gift, there are plenty of great options available under $30.</p>



<h3><strong>Warranty</strong></h3>



<p>Make sure that you choose a mouse with at least a 1-year warranty from the manufacturer in case there are any defects or malfunctions.

<p>The Support Role in League of Legends is likely the most difficult to play. Rivaled only perhaps by the Jungle, Supports take a lot of time, effort, and skill to learn and master. And even then, you never know what may happen as synergy between you and your fellow ADC is also paramount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help you ease yourself into the Role or make things easier overall if you’re already vested in the Support world, we’ve decided to compile a list of Champions that strive in the Laning Phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Laning Phase is extremely important and probably the most important part of the game. It serves as a setup for the things to come. A team that dominates the Laning Phase severely will, in all likelihood, emerge victorious from the game. Though there are exceptions to this rule, it is a widespread occurrence that must not be overlooked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These Champions are not only viable for the Laning Phase; all of them have their utility outside of the Lane as well, which we will go over when we get to the list.</p>



<p>Not to drag too much, let us begin with the <strong>5 Best Laning Phase Supports in League of Legends! </strong>(This list is in no particular order.)&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15029" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Thresh is one of the most challenging Support Champions, as indicated in our <strong>Hardest Supports</strong> list that you should definitely check out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This difficulty stems from his heavy reliance on accurate skill shots. Hitting these skill shots, however, will yield all the benefits you can think of. They are handy during the early Laning Phase, and here’s why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thresh can apply a lot of pressure on the opposing duo and represents a constant threat of engagement whenever he gets even the slightest opening. The enemy will persistently try to hide behind minions and cower in fear not to get hooked. Landing hooks is lethal and has a high chance of getting a kill, especially when followed by Thresh’s E.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These two spells alone are great early game CC that, when combined with the right Champions, will allow you to get kills and a lot of farm while denying minions to the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though difficult, he’s a fantastic pick for both the Laning Phase and late-game encounters. He can close the gap quickly and allow your team to focus on a single valuable target, eliminating them efficiently. He’s often a Tank, so he’ll have no issue engaging opponents, and mastering his combos will only increase his impact on your games.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15027" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Leona is one of the heaviest Supports in the game. I say this due to just how much CC she has. She feels like a heavy Champion that, when she attaches herself to you, she obliterates you on the spot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She’s not too difficult to play, though not as easy either. She’s heavily reliant on skill shots – her E and Ultimate are some of the most valuable spells to have on a team, and they need to be accurately used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leona has some of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most robust CC </a>in her kit, allowing her to stun opponents for ages. The cooldowns are not too bad either, making her a constant threat within the Lane. Her E goes through minions, meaning that hiding behind them isn’t an option against this Champion. </p>



<p>This gives Leona a lot of zoning power, and a good Leona player will use her intimidating nature to keep the enemy away from the farm as much as possible. Overextension is an issue with noob Leona players that think she’s omnipotent, and you should be aware of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A good combination with Leona would be Lucian whose high <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/dps-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="13394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DPS</a> in the early game can capitalize on her abundant <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>. She’s always been an excellent Support pick, and whenever I included her in a list – I gave her a strong recommendation, and this one is no exception.  </p>

<h2><strong>3. Pantheon</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15028" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Pantheon is usually a Champion that you’d see on the Top Lane. Lately, though, he’s found his way into the Support Role. And he’s doing pretty good at it, with solid win rates in high and low Elo rankings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to his Fighter nature and his Top Lane design, Pantheon is exceptionally aggressive. He can engage and take very little damage using his W and E, allowing for some profitable trades. If he happens to get zoned back, he can use his long-range Q to poke the enemy for solid damage safely. Pantheon can do a ton of damage, something that only gets better as the game progresses.</p>



<p>Near the end of the Laning Phase, he’s already one great, engaging Champion that can start fights and isolate crucial targets. As I’ve said, he also possesses excellent range, allowing for some nice starting damage to get the chances in your favor before the fight even begins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s super easy to play, though his Q does take a bit of getting used to. Once you master this otherwise amazing Bruiser, you’ve got a great Champion on your hands that can do many great things.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Karma</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15026" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Karma is undoubtedly my favorite Support to play. As a Top Lane main, I don’t verse myself into the Support Role that often (or ever, honestly.) But sometimes, that pesky auto-fill finds its way to me and sends me on the path of Supporting – and Karma is always my choice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She is one of the strongest Laning Phase Champions damage-wise in the entire game. At level 1, she can already use her Ultimate to amplify her Q and deal massive Magic damage, setting the enemy at an immediate disadvantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This continues throughout the Laning Phase, and she’ll poke and harass a lot with her extraordinary range and damage. If the enemy retaliates, she has tools against that, too. Using her W, she can put a solid CC onto an enemy. Though not as effective as Leona’s stuns, this root acts as a solid disable to help Karma and her laner retreat to safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her E is a great shield that only gets better with her Ultimate. It can have an <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AOE</a> effect, shielding and boosting the movement speed of both Karma and her ally. All of this is possible from level 3 and above, as Karma has her Ultimate unlocked from the get-go. </p>



<p>She’s a potent Enchanter that I believe superior over the likes of Lux and Seraphine. Her damage is just too severe, and her mobility isn’t lacking in the slightest. I genuinely recommend this Champion for any skill level, as she doesn’t take that much to get used to or learn.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>5. Amumu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15025" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Amumu has been an S+ tier Jungler since his kit was updated. Though it was a minor update per se, it severely changed how good Amumu can be, and that is not only true for the Jungle but his other viable Roles as well. One of those Roles is, of course, the Support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like Leona, Amumu can apply heavy pressure and scare the enemies into submission with his constant circling around the minions. He’s a tank right off the bat and can only get tankier from there. This allows him to engage without too much fear, and his primary tool of attack will be his two charge Q. If both charges are hit, they will amount to a 2s stun, well enough time to kill just about any target in the game, let alone an ADC or Support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d say he synergizes best with the same Champions Leona does – Lucian, Tristana, and other <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-dps-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="13397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high DPS Champions</a> that don’t take too long to do damage even in the Laning Phase. </p>



<p>He’s straightforward and powerful both on the Lane and outside of it. His team fighting potential is notorious, and that Ultimate speaks for itself. If he hits level 6 quickly on the Lane – it’s pretty much game over for the opposing side, and they will not be able to win a single fight after that. Although I’d watch out for overextending and pick my fights, isolating is always better than going head-on into a group.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>As I’ve claimed at the beginning, the Laning Phase is an essential part of the game. Having the right Champions picked for this phase can decide matches in the Champion Select.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, some Champions may be weak in the Laning Phase but dominate the game later on.</p>



<p> An excellent example of this is Kai’Sa, a <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-hyper-carries/" data-type="post" data-id="9744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyper carry</a> with a notoriously weak Laning Phase and perhaps the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-late-game-adcs/" data-type="post" data-id="12887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Late Game ADC</a>. At any rate, doing well early on is a critical factor for the game’s eventual outcome. </p>

<p>There are certain champions in League of Legends that you rarely see, and one of those champions is Bard. He provides decent healing and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-peel-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8589" target="_blank">peels</a>, but not enough to be relevant for season 12. But when he is partnered with particular ADC&#8217;s, it won&#8217;t matter if he&#8217;s meta or not. Today I&#8217;ll tell you the best ADC&#8217;s you can partner with Bard so you can win more games even if you pick a low pick rate champion. </p>



<h2><strong>1. Sivir</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15016" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Bard excels in heals for his champion, and when enemies get close enough, he can slow and stun them. That is pretty much it for his laning phase. But combine him with a champion that has a pretty strong wave clear, then you have yourself a duo that can quickly roam because of Bard&#8217;s Magical Journey.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Sivir can quickly dispose of the oncoming enemy wave during mid-game and proceed to roam mid with Bard. They can also work together with their jungle to counter the jungle enemy team. Doing this would put a massive lead on your team and excellent<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-get-better-at-warding-in-league/" data-type="post" data-id="8478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> map control</a>. Sivir relies on her Q damage most of the time, along with her movement speed. Sure, she can self-peel using her spell shield, but when her skills come on cooldown, she gets very vulnerable as she lacks dash skills except for her flash. This is where Bard comes in. Bard has great roaming potential because of his high movement speed provided by his passive, the Meeps. Bard can quickly run towards Sivir and provide her peeling and heals. Bard can also use his ultimate to either set up a fight or protect his running teammates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bard and Sivir can combine their skills for the best peeling technique. When Sivir gets gap closed by the enemy bruisers, Bard can cast his ultimate directly on Sivir. She can use her spell shield to make herself immune from Bard&#8217;s ult, this would turn enemies beside Sivir to Gold, and she can run unaffected and able to move.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Best Item to Build on Bard for Sivir</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Shurelya&#8217;s Reverie</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="588" height="311" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-sivir.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15021" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-sivir.png 588w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-sivir-300x159.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-sivir-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></figure></div>



<p>This Item is excellent for initiating team fights or disengaging. This would work for a quick in-and-out pick. But most importantly, this would work with Sivir as it would extend Sivir&#8217;s much-needed movement speed. Sivir can cast her ultimate to provide her a burst of movement speed along with her allies. Bard can also follow up if they need it again to chase or run away from an enemy. The regens and cooldown reduction also work so well for Bard.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>2. Caitlyn</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15013" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Caitlyn can dominate most ADC&#8217;s on the bot lane simply because she has a more extended range than them. Her basic attacks and skills can be cast at ranges farther than other ADC&#8217;s. Caitlyn also has her ultimate, which is basically a sniper, which you probably know so much about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like all ADC&#8217;s, Caitlyn also needs heals to help her survive the lane, but their synergy comes when Bard casts his crowd control abilities. Bard can stun enemies using his Q ability. Enemies caught by his Q will be slowed, and when a wall or another unit is behind them, both units will be stunned. Caitlyn can take advantage of this and cast her W ability to root them even longer. Caitlyn can deal bonus damage on enemies caught by her W, and if you play Caitlyn well, you can follow it up on a quick burst of combo.</p>



<p>Another thing that this duo can do is bait enemies into Bard&#8217;s magical journey. Enemies will come out of it, and Bard can stun them against the wall pinning them into location. Caitlyn can also use her trap at the end of the tunnel and follow it up with a quick burst combo. With this duo, you can have a massive impact on the entire map because of the range of their skills, along with their excellent roaming potential.</p>



<h3><strong>The Best Item to Build on Bard for Caitlyn</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Locket of the Iron Solari</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="588" height="311" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-caitlyn.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15018" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-caitlyn.png 588w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-caitlyn-300x159.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-caitlyn-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></figure></div>



<p>Caitlyn is susceptible to bursts from assassins or DPS from champions with poisons or burns like Brand&#8217;s. Locket counters those things with a blast of shield from its active ability. This item also has a unique passive that gives nearby allied champions 5 bonus armor and magic resist. An item that offers a very squishy champion its much-needed survivability.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>3. Miss Fortune</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15015" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Miss Fortune depends on her allies&#8217; crowd control abilities to help her land her skills. She can build different paths, a crit build that relies on her basic attacks for damage which doesn&#8217;t need any CC help from her allies. Another build is a lethality build that empowers her ultimate.<br>Bard can help set up kills for Miss Fortune. One basic combo they can do during the laning phase is for Bard to land his stun on both the enemy duo. They will be perfectly aligned for MF&#8217;s Q double shot. Follow it up with her E slow ability and back away. This is a simple but strong trading technique with this duo to win the lane early on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Miss Fortune also excels in the late game, so she needs all the babysitting she can get during the early game. Bard provides just that with his heals and crowd controls. During the late game, whatever MF&#8217;s build is, Bard can set up kills for her. Bard can land his ult on multiple enemy team members to prepare for MF&#8217;s E + R combo. This could quickly decimate the enemy team, causing them to back off or disengage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Best Item to Build on Bard for Miss Fortune</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Mikael&#8217;s Blessing</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="592" height="271" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-miss-fortune.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15020" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-miss-fortune.png 592w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-miss-fortune-300x137.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-miss-fortune-150x69.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></figure></div>



<p>Miss Fortune lacks self-peeling abilities, so she badly needs her support. Mikael&#8217;s Blessing would be a great addition to Bard&#8217;s already fantastic arsenal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Xayah</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15017" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Xayah was once very popular as an ADC; she is commonly used on the world&#8217;s stage, and for a good reason. She has decent damage output and great range. She also has a self-peel ability which is her ultimate that makes her untargetable for a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Xayah and Bard are powerful duos because of their abilities to peel for themselves. Bard can give her heals during the laning phase. Planting multiple ones beside the tower, Xayah can ultimately trade with the enemy ADC during the early game. As she has guaranteed heals waiting for her, just a few steps behind. One of her primary damage sources comes from pulling her passive ability towards her. </p>



<p>This can easily be set with Bard&#8217;s ultimate, which puts the enemy team on stasis for a few seconds. Xayah can put as many feathers as she can before bard ults the enemy team. Just as when they are about to come out of stasis, Xayah can pull her feathers towards her for an intense burst of damage. If some survive, she can surely kill them as she also has high range and damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Bard, you can build on utility active items to protect your Xayah so she can prioritize building herself damaged items. They can both play aggressively in the early or late game, given that Bard lands his ult and Q at the right place and time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>5. Ezreal</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15014" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Perhaps the best champion to partner with Bard can self-peel and have a long-range to stay safe as Bard<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/leagueoflegend/4-best-roaming-mid-laners/" data-type="post" data-id="9277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> roams the map</a>. Ezreal excels just that. This type of strategy is called a weak side play which the lane doesn&#8217;t require that much assistance from his other allies.</p>



<p>Bard can leave his health skills besides the tower for Ezreal to use, and he can then proceed to roam the other lanes to help them. This would be highly beneficial to the team as Ezreal can farm solo with his gold and exp. Bard also puts leads on his other teammates as the game goes on. Once Ezreal builds the core items, Bard can go back to him and give him assistance to secure kills so they can both snowball into winning the game.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Best Item to Build on Bard for Ezreal</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Redemption</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="592" height="285" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-ezreal.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15019" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-ezreal.png 592w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-ezreal-300x144.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-ezreal-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></figure></div>



<p>As Bard spends most of his time roaming the map, warding enemy jungle camps, or helping secure kills in the mid or top lane, he also needs to influence the bot lane. Redemption is perfect as this Item has a very long range that can heal allies and damage enemies caught within its range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So those are the 5 best champions you can pick as an ADC when you have a Bard support. Remember that the best champions to partner Bard with are champions with long-range or self-peel abilities as Bard is a champion meant to roam the entire map. His passive the meeps are scattered throughout the map; picking one up gives him movement speed which would really help him roam the other lanes. So even though Bard has a low pick rate, I hope you know when is the best time to pick him. GLHF on your next game summoner, see you on the rift.</p>

<p>The Laning Phase is a crucial part of the game. It is a core period that will serve as a setup for future events. The chances that you’ll win the game are greatly improved by doing well during the Laning Phase, so having the best Champions for it is a bonus.</p>



<p>That is where this list comes in, and it will help you understand the key Laning aspects of a Champion. We’ve spoken about the Laning Phase in two other lists. Namely, they are the <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-laning-phase-supports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Laning Phase Supports</a> </strong>and <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-laning-phase-adcs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Laning Phase ADCs</a></strong>. </p>



<p>If you’re an avid Bot Lane player, I highly suggest you check out those two lists as they contain some helpful information about Bot Laning Phase synergies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the introduction out of the way, let us begin with the <strong>5 Best Laning Phase Mid Laners in League of Legends.</strong> (This list is in no particular order.)</p>



<h2><strong>1. Zed</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15153" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-zed.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Zed is one of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/the-most-difficult-league-of-legends-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="8685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardest Champions </a>to deal with in the Lane, especially during the Assassin meta that has no end in sight. He is an energy-based Champion, meaning that he can poke and spam spells without it costing him too much. </p>



<p>The energy regenerates at a blazing fast rate, and there are even tools in his kit to speed the process up, making it abundant most of the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zed has a ton of damage. It is high right off the bat and only gets stronger as the game goes on. His passive makes him one of the most satisfying Champions to Lane and farm with. The extra damage on low-health enemies turns farming into an afterthought. You will often see Zed players with insane CS by the time mid-game rolls around because of this powerful passive.</p>



<p>He has a lot of pokes and fighting capacities and is the best Assassin in the game (and the <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-assassin-junglers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Assassin Jungler</a></strong>.) This Champion goes beyond everything you’ve ever encountered, and it is fun to see him evolve with the meta. </p>



<p>I highly recommend you get on mastering Zed right now while the LP is still free with him.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Orianna</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15151" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-orianna.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Orianna is among my favorite Mid Laners and, indeed, my favorite Mage. She has a great Laning Phase that will see her ramp up a lot of CS and even kills during it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Orianna is a unique one because everything about her revolves around the ball she carries around. Her Q moves the thing about and serves as Orianna’s primary poke tool, together with her W.</p>



<p>&nbsp;She also has a great basic attack that does a lot of damage, allowing her to farm easily and even use it to poke a melee opponent if she happens to encounter one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her overall Laning Phase is straightforward and safe. It will revolve a lot around managing the ball’s position and poking your enemy to prepare for the level 6 all-in. After 6 you can begin roaming. Your wave clear will become a lot more powerful, allowing for often wave crashing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whatever your playstyle with Orianna, she’s a fantastic Champion that will only get stronger as the game goes on. In the Late Game, Orianna will become the deciding factor of team fights due to her incredible Ultimate ability, which you have to experience at least once in your life.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Also read: <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-play-against-katarina" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How To Counter Katarina</a></strong></p>



<h2><strong>3. Katarina</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15150" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-katarina.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Katarina is, like Zed, among the <strong>best Assassins </strong>in the game. Unlike Zed, though, she has no resource. Energy allows for a lot of ability spam, yes, but having <em>no</em> costs is a lot better, don’t you agree?</p>



<p>The sole fact that her spells cost nothing to use gives Katarina the ability to poke the enemy into oblivion right from level 1. She’ll mainly poke using her Q, a spell that becomes a real spammer during the Late Game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being a melee Champion, Katarina has a lot of dangers to face on the Mid Lane. Many Mid Lane Mages tend to be ranged, exposing Katarina to a lot of poking and harassing or even zoning if they manage to beat her at the start.</p>



<p>Katarina’s strong emphasis on roaming mitigates this, and she will be walking over to the Bot Lane before Laning has even ended. Picking up a few kills early on makes Katarina impossible to stop in the Late Game, as she has one of the strongest snowballs out there.</p>



<p>At any rate, she’s excellent on the Lane, no matter how you choose to play her. No two matches are the same, and your experience with her might differ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d still play her, though, can’t go wrong with Kata.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Vex</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15152" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-vex.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Vex is the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/safest-mid-lane-picks/" data-type="post" data-id="13188">safest pick for a Mid Laner</a> in the current patch. She can farm, poke, harass and do pretty much everything from a safe distance. There is no need for Vex to get any closer than she is, making her very hard to kill. </p>



<p>Her passive fills up slowly but surely, which eventually leads to a strong poke. Playing as a melee against Vex is impossible if she does everything right. Constantly dodging and evading her attacks is complex, and she will get you low enough for a full engagement after a few strong hits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if she uses her spells too much, she’ll likely shove the Lane too far, and that’s the only downside to her playstyle. You can opt to farm with basic attacks exclusively, but you will miss out on poking the enemy laner with your otherwise powerful spells.</p>



<p>Roaming is a no-brainer with an Ultimate such as hers, and she will do it from the moment she hits level 6. The Laning Phase for Vex is just a time waste that she can’t wait to get out of, despite performing well within it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She’s a real Late Game treat that everyone hates, and you should give her a spin to hate her even more.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>5. Annie</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15149" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-mid-laners-annie.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>As one of the oldest Champions in the game, Annie is as simple as they get. Farming with her is straightforward. Using her Q, she can guarantee a minion hit, and her mana will be refunded. Repeat this process, and boom – you have an insane CS advantage over your opponent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you stack up those 4 stacks, it’s time to divert that Q into the enemy Champion. The Q-W all-in at 4 stacks can do a ton of damage, making Annie one of the strongest level 2 all-ins. By the time you reach level 6 you’re going to be an insane burst damage caster that everyone will fear.</p>



<p>There is no player in the game that doesn’t know Annie and her bear Tibbers. I highly recommend avoiding these two when you see that purple bar filled up beneath her health bar. If she gets too close, well – let’s say you and Tibbers will be better acquainted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laning Phase, roaming, and the late game are Annie’s expertise. She can do it all and do it well, with lots of tools on her kit. I recommend trying her if you’re new to the Mid Lane, as she is very easy to play and learn.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>As I’ve said at the beginning, the Laning Phase is a crucial part of the game that can determine the outcome by itself. Though there are exceptions to this rule, they are few, and having the right Champion to win the Laning Phase is paramount. The Victory screen and that positive LP increase are all we want to see, so be sure to study these lists well to ensure your success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’ve spoken previously about the <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-laning-phase-supports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Laning Phase Support Champions</a></strong> in League, so I only think it’s natural that I talk a bit about the ADCs, as well. An ADC and a Support are like bread and butter, and they scarcely can go without one another. </p>



<p>Studying these two lists will tremendously help you and your potential duo partner to create a vicious Laning Phase combo that will destroy enemies right from the get-go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ADC role is a difficult one, especially when it comes to Laning. Champions differ significantly in this regard, despite performing the same role in general. This is where the list comes in to rescue you and help you not wander around the internet trying to find a suitable pick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, without further ado, let us begin with the <strong>5 Best Laning Phase ADCs in League of Legends.</strong> (This list is in no particular order.)</p>



<h2><strong>1. Caitlyn</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15141" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-caitlyn.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Caitlyn is one of the most challenging enemies to go up against on the Lane and off of it. There are many reasons why this might be, so let’s discuss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Caitlyn has some of the most extended range in the entire game. She can safely farm from a distance and poke without breaking a sweat. Her traps and her net only help to increase said range and even amplify damage. I look at Cait as an Assassin ADC, as she has that potential to one-shot enemies and embodies the role of a hunter with her traps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With her Q, Caitlyn has a great tool to do severe damage early on. You’ll deal the total damage if you aim it correctly and hit the Champion first rather than the minions. The spell’s damage falls off if it passes through an enemy, though it does expand in width.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At any rate, Caitlyn is a safe and powerful pick that anyone can enjoy. Mastering her, however, is no easy task, and it will take a few games to get the hang of her. Once you do, though, you’re pretty much set for the rest of your ADC career, as Caitlyn never fails to be viable or strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>2. Draven</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15142" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-draven.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Draven is another safe pick that, despite not having as big of a range as Caitlyn, hits as hard as a truck. He is a bit on the difficult side, and I’ve even named him one of the <strong><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/hardest-adcs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardest ADCs</a></strong> in another list. </p>



<p>Despite that, Draven remains one of the best Laning Phase Champions and one of the rare ones where Laning is actually emphasized. You see, Draven’s passive increases whenever he kills a minion. His Axes also contribute to this whenever he catches one. Farming with his Q will quickly ramp up those Adoration stacks that will net you a lot of extra gold when you land a kill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And even if you don’t land a kill, your chances only get better as his Ultimate executes enemies that have less HP than he has stacks of Adoration. This has been the source of many memes, including Pianta’s video where he killed an enemy using only Draven’s R.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s insane how strong he can get just by farming and Laning, so you can quickly figure out why he’s on this list.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>3. Tristana</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-tristana-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15145" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-tristana-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-tristana-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-tristana-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-tristana-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-tristana-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-tristana-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-tristana.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Tristana speaks for herself, but I’ll give some detail to her. She is one of the highest DPS ADCs in the game, at least in the early stages. At level 3, she becomes a powerhouse that can get fed in minutes when paired with the proper Support like Leona or Thresh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most of this comes from Tristana’s E. It sets a bomb charge on the target enemy (yes, it is a point and click) that ticks and explodes, doing AOE damage. Tristana can attack the charged enemy, which will increase the spell’s damage substantially. If she hits the enemy 4 times, the charge will deal 120% extra damage and explode immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At level 3, when both Tristana and her Support have 3 spells available, they can simply CC the enemy, and Tristana’s charge will do the rest. At that low of a level and during the remainder of the Laning Phase, Tristana’s charge can more or less one-shot enemies.</p>



<p>If she gets those 4 hits off, it’s game over, making her one of the hardest Laning Phase ADCs to deal with. As I’ve said, she synergizes best with the likes of Leona and Thresh, both of whom were in our <strong>best Laning Phase Supports</strong> list.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Ashe</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15140" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-ashe.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Ashe, like the first two on the list, is a safe pick. She can farm easily, and it is pretty satisfying to use her basic attacks. They are nicely animated and provide for a fun experience just farming about the Lane.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a distance, she can poke the enemies with her W, and if she feels extra spicy, fighting is the name of the game. But most of the time, she’ll safely farm using either her basic attacks or her W, with the occasional Q toggle to shove the minion waves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If she gets dragged into a fight, the Q mentioned above is an all-powerful spell that will obliterate squishy health bars right off the bat. As the game progresses, this only gets worse (or better), making Ashe a solid mid-game solution to the ADC role.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her Ultimate is a global spell that allows her to remain present on other parts of the map while still in the Laning Phase. Though it is a skill shot and tends to be difficult to use from a distance, it is certainly nice to have, and landing it will substantially help your allies across the map.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She’s simple, one of the old ones and a fun pick to play both on and off the Lane, and I’d highly recommend you take her for a spin.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>5. Miss fortune</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15144" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-adcs-miss-fortune.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Miss Fortune, everyone’s favorite pirate hunter. Well, if you’re not a Gangplank main, that is (like myself). There’s scarcely a Champion that’s easier to farm with than Miss Fortune, and her passive explains it all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You get extra damage on the first hit against an enemy. It’s that simple. She can use this to ensure a 100% execution on every minion, even if she misses that near-death mark. Farming is satisfying with MF, and if the enemy happens to stay behind a minion – well, you’ve got a solution for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her Q goes through the first enemy hit and jumps to any enemy standing too close. This second shot does a lot more damage as well, meaning that it’s a fantastic poke ability. It helps MF zone the enemies greatly and poking with her Q, basic, and E is straightforward. These 3 abilities combined will drive your opponents crazy, and they won’t even be able to catch you because of your excellent W.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It gives MF movement speed, nicely increasing her mobility (which he dramatically lacks). Her Ultimate makes MF one of the best team fighters in the game, and she is undoubtedly one of the better picks to have in your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone loves Sarah, and I believe you’ll have just as much fun if you give her a try.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>The Laning Phase is one of the most critical parts of a League of Legends match. It serves to set up everything that happens later on, though that can change on a whim based on some other factors. At any rate, if you win the Laning Phase, chances are you’ll win the game, too – and having the right tool for the job is always better than arriving unprepared.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In League of Legends, there are various types of damage done over time. There’s burning, leeching, Death’s Dance proccing, etc. Among these also counts poisoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Poison in League of Legends is a damage source available to a minimal number of Champions. Four, to be precise. We will cover all four of them in this list, as it wouldn’t make much sense to exclude anyone from it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since there are only four, I can detail them and their mechanics other than the poison abilities. They vary largely between each other and are played in all roles in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to their inherent differences in playstyle, I will refrain from numbering this list and name them, go over their strengths and weaknesses, and you be the judge of the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No Champion on this list is inherently better than the other. The situations vary, and your experience will be different in each game you play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with that out of the way, let us begin with the <strong>Best Poison Champions in League of Legends.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Cassiopeia</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15100" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-cassiopeia.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Out of all the Champions named in this list, Cass has perhaps the most extensive reliance on poison in her kit. Everything revolves around poison with her spells, save for her Ultimate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Embodying her snake form, Cass’ Q and W are poisoning abilities from which her E scales incredibly. She’s more or less a straightforward Champion, and thus her Q is an uncomplicated blast of poisonous cloud, and her W covers the ground with poison goo. While standing in her W, Champions are grounded, meaning they can’t Flash, dash, jump, or do anything of the sort.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the game progresses, her poison can get lethal. This is especially the case when combined with items like Liandry’s that will chunk any Champion’s HP hard with the press of a button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This brings me to her E. If the target is poisoned, Cassiopeia’s E will deal bonus damage and heal her. In the late game, this 0.75s cooldown spell becomes a rapid-firing poison barrage that no one can escape from. Simply use your Q to poison the enemies and your W to keep them in place, and follow up with a machine gun of venomous fangs to bring the enemy to heel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cassiopeia is an interesting Champion, all things considered. She doesn’t buy boots but gets passive movement speed. Riot explained this with her lack of feet, and I mean – it does make sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This allows Cass to have an extra free item slot to replace the boots, giving her a massive advantage over most other Champions that can only have up to 5 items in their inventory. That is, if they want to keep their movement speed and not trade it for an item.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She has a sky<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/10-highest-skill-cap-champions-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">-high skill cap</a>, and it will take you a lot of games to learn her otherwise brutal combos. Taking your time to master her will pay off, however, and will lead you to an LP increase in no time. </p>

<h2><strong>2. Teemo</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15102" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-teemo.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Teemo is a poisonous little scumbag that everyone hates to see in their games. He is also one of the best Top Laners in the current meta, enjoying an almost permanent S+ tier ranking on u.gg. With a win rate of over 52%, he remains a proper bastard, so let’s talk about him for a little bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teemo’s poison is attached to both his E and his Ultimate. Though I’d said that Cass is the only one whose whole kit revolves around poison, Teemo is a close second. He is a Champion that relies a little bit too much on damage over time and his Mushrooms. The Mushroom placement can easily highlight the difference between a good and a bad Teemo player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the early game, Teemo will use his poison to poke and harass the hell out of the enemy Laner. As most Top Lane Champions will be melee, Teemo has almost no counterplay and can have a field day with any opponent he encounters. His shrooms at level 6 will serve as glorified wards and a way to do extra damage during 1v1 fights within large minion waves.</p>



<p>As the game progresses, he will gradually lose his reliance on auto attacks and focus a lot more on his shroom placement. Planting shrooms around chokepoints is crucial to maintain the enemy’s heightened sense of danger. They will always tread lightly and carefully around each narrow pathway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will significantly help deter enemies trying to approach your team during objective taking like Drake and Baron. Remember that enemies can easily detect your Mushrooms by using the Sweeping Lens trinket or with Control Wards. They will immediately focus on using these two tools, so be sure to place shrooms at <em>very</em> unexpected spots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teemo is a god currently and is incredibly easy to play, learn and master. I highly recommend you play him, though if you’re on EUNE, I will gladly ban it to prevent you from doing so.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Twitch</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15103" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-twitch.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Twitch is the <em>least</em> poisonous of all the Champions listed here. Though he constantly poisons his enemies with his basic attacks and W, he does very little poison damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twitch has a poison attacked to his passive that deals true damage, rather than magic like the rest of the entries on this list. At level 18 and max stacks, this spell can deal 30 true damage per second. It also scales off of AP slightly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That may seem a lot, and I know I’ve said that Twitch does very little poison damage. Early in the game, he will struggle to maintain anything over 2 to 3 stacks which will deal about 5-6 true damage per second. That amount is easily mitigated if the enemy has an Enchanting Support, a shield, or other healing sources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the late game, his reliance on the poison diminishes greatly, and he will turn into your run-of-the-mill ADC like any other. The importance of his poison is executing low HP enemies using his E, which does damage based on the number of passive stacks Twitch has on an enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is his primary use for the poison and not the poison itself. It is a finishing touch that will help Twitch end the opponents before they manage to escape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Twitch is an ADC, as indicated. Learning any ADC will take time, and it is a unique way of playing the game altogether. Positioning, farming, and other mechanics must be deeply studied and learned by heart before any significant step in progressing with a Champion is made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you do master these mechanics, though, no other role in the game will seem difficult, at least in terms of Laning. You’ll have to figure everything else by yourself as it will heavily rely on your general learning ability and how well you grasp new things in this game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, no one truly <em>learns</em> League entirely as it is an ever-changing environment, and you never know what’s waiting in the next patch.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>4. Singed</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15101" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-poison-champs-singed.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Singed is a Top Laner. That’s all I have to say about him. He can be played elsewhere, but Top is his home, and he’s there to say, and I mean it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His poison comes from his insane Q that, when activated, leaves behind him a trail of smoke that will poison anyone that walks through it. It is a toggle spell, meaning Singed can turn it on and off at will. While active, it will slowly drain his mana and automatically deactivate when he runs out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Singed’s entire playstyle is centered around this spell. Most players will use it to proxy farm waves behind the enemy’s tower, piling up a massive amount of solo gold and XP over time. He can rarely be stopped, as he has a lot of tools to escape and fight if the need arises.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His W and E are both crowd control spells that can stun enemies for a solid amount if used correctly. Even when used separately, these spells are pretty powerful. The W acts similarly to Cass’ Miasma, which grounds people are highly slowed to the point of a stun being preferable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The E lunges enemies behind Singed. It allows him to use his Ultimate to boost movement speed, run into the enemies, and fling one into his team for quick execution. There’s an infinite amount of things to do with Singed once you’ve mastered him, though I wouldn’t recommend doing so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You see, Singed is a very niche character to play as and has one of the lowest player counts of all Champions in the game. He’s just bad most of the time, and there are scarcely capable hands that can use him correctly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At any rate, you can try him if you want. I wouldn’t, but I’m not your dad.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>As we can see, poison mechanics can be found in every type of Champion you can think of. From the casting Mage Cassiopeia to the tanky moron Singed. Though limited to only this tiny pool of Champions, poison is no joke when found on an overfed player.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These lists take time and effort to make so leave feedback to help us improve them. Keep a keen eye out on our website for more League of Legends-related content such as guides, lists, and articles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gaming laptops are often the peak of laptop performance. They offer desktop PC-like specs (or sometimes even better than desktop PCs), in a compact package that comes at a competitive price. Gaming laptops can provide the user with a device with a sturdy build quality, great battery life, and amazing performance. Another thing that gaming laptops are known for are their designs. Generally, gaming laptops are characterized by their bold, flashy, and colorful designs. With LED RGB back-lit keyboards and shells that will remind you of alien spaceships (looking at you Alienware), gaming laptops are certainly not afraid to stand out amongst the crowd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, let’s just say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Expanding on that, we’re not really sure if all beholders find the “exciting” designs of gaming laptops desirable. Maybe they want something understated, mature. Something they can bring into conference rooms without raising everyone’s eyebrows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, at the same time, they can’t compromise on performance and specs. If you’re one of those people and you’ve found yourself in this conundrum, this article will surely help you out.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>In a hurry? Here are our top 3 picks for the best gaming laptop that doesn&#8217;t look like gaming laptops!</em></strong></p>

<h2><strong>Are Gaming Laptops Better Than Normal Laptops?</strong></h2>



<p>The answer to this question, like always, depends on the user. However, looking at things from a general perspective, we could say that yes, gaming laptops are better than normal laptops. This comparison works if we compare them on a technical level. Gaming laptops are designed to handle heavy and demanding tasks, they perform better and are more suited to manage large loads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaming laptops’ CPUs (Central Processing Units) and GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are specially designed and developed to take on heavy gaming and due to this, they can also handle CPU/GPU intensive tasks such as software development, 3D animation, graphic design, video editing, photo editing, etc. No matter what requirement you have, gaming laptops can meet your needs and they can do it effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there are a couple of caveats to gaming laptops. These are their battery life and cost. Gaming laptops are notorious for getting low battery life and not lasting throughout the day. Regular laptops built for office/college use tend to last longer because they don’t have the high-end components that drain battery life quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next problem with gaming laptops is that they are usually priced very high. Paying a high price for a heavy-duty laptop doesn’t make sense if you don’t really need the fancy spec sheet. If all you require is a laptop that you can use MS office on, browse with or watch movies on, you’re better off with choosing a normal laptop that will not only come at a lower price, but will get you longer battery life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s go through some standard comparisons between gaming laptops and normal laptops. Gaming laptops are high-performance machines with large amounts of RAM and dedicated graphics cards that can handle heavy-duty work. On the other hand, normal laptops have processors that are made to work with basic and low-intensity tasks. Normal laptops also tend to use integrated graphics cards which don’t offer much in terms of graphics capabilities. The displays and speakers that gaming laptops come with are advanced and impressive. </p>



<p>Gaming laptops display crisp (sometimes 4K) images at a high refresh rate and the sound from their speakers goes up to high volumes without losing its quality. Whereas, with normal laptops, you get standard refresh rates and speakers. However, there are some normal laptops at higher price points that do feature high-quality sound and picture quality.</p>



<h2><strong>Are Gaming Laptops Good for Daily Use?</strong></h2>



<p>The answer to this question really comes down to your personal requirements. Gaming laptops can obviously easily handle any everyday task you throw at them, so that shouldn’t be much of a problem. I mean, if a laptop can handle Cyberpunk at 60fps, I’m pretty sure it can also handle watching Netflix and taking notes. The only problems you’re likely to face are portability and battery life. </p>



<p>Gaming laptops are notorious for being heavy and not lasting long enough. However, the laptops on this list are pretty light and slim, which will help with portability. Coming to the battery issue, as long as you’re not putting the laptop under a lot of load, the battery should last longer than it would while playing games. You could also carry around a spare battery to swap out whenever the first one runs out!</p>



<h2><strong>Reviewing The Top 7 Gaming Laptops</strong></h2>



<p>Now let’s take a close look at 7 of the best gaming laptops on the market right now that don’t really look like gaming laptops. We will be listing down the pros and cons of each laptop, along with some specs and details.</p>

<p>Kicking off the list, we have the Razer Blade 15 Advanced Gaming Laptop (2021). This is an update to last year’s Razer Blade 15 and has quite some improvements to take note of. We have chosen this laptop to be our best overall choice among all the laptops in this list. The reasons behind this decision become clear once you look at its configurations and details.</p>



<h3><strong>Specs</strong></h3>



<ul><li>RAM: (Up to) 32GB DDR4-2933MHz 16GBx2</li><li>Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080</li><li>Display: 15 Inch FHD 360Hz or QHD 240Hz or 4K</li><li>Storage: 1TB PCIe NVMe</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Why is this the best gaming laptop that doesn’t look like a gaming laptop?</strong></h3>



<p>If you have any doubts as to why we’ve chosen the Razer Blade 15 Advanced 2021 as our top pick, allow me to clear it up for you. For starters, the Razer Blade 15 Advanced 2021 ticks off our one main requirement. The laptop can’t look like a gaming laptop. Well, be rest assured, as this laptop certainly doesn’t look like a gaming laptop and goes for a low-key, understated design with a matte black exterior and the Razer logo proudly displayed on the back.</p>



<p>Apart from fulfilling our primary requirement, the laptop is also well specced and built to last. Despite being thin and light (for a gaming laptop), it consists of all the ports you could need, along with a Kensington lock. The full-size SD card reader in the laptop is another solid addition to the already attractive package. The laptop’s display is magnificent and the bezels on the sides are quite thin as well. All of these reasons, and many more, make the Razer Blade 15 Advanced 2021, our top pick for a gaming laptop that doesn’t look like a gaming laptop.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Gaming Laptop That Doesn’t Look Like a Gaming Laptop?</strong></h2>



<p>To help you choose the best gaming laptop that doesn&#8217;t look like a gaming laptop, we’ve listed down some key points to go over while making your choice. Keep in mind that each point is subjective and how you see it should depend on your personal use and requirements and not what is considered to be good.</p>



<h3><strong>Design</strong></h3>



<p>As we’re looking for gaming laptops that don’t look like gaming laptops, the design should be a major priority. Try to stay away from flashy colors, lots of RGB, or crazy cuts, lines, and creases.</p>



<h3><strong>Processors</strong></h3>



<p>The processor, or the CPU, of your laptop is the main engine that will help you drive it. Getting the latest generation processors is a good idea as it will make sure that your laptop remains useful for the coming years and doesn’t become obsolete. As a minimum, look for an Intel Core i5-3570K or better in terms of CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 or AMD Radeon R9 290X or better in terms of a GPU. Anything lower would just not work in today’s time.</p>



<h3><strong>Portability</strong></h3>



<p>If you’re planning on using your laptop on the go, then make sure that it is light and comes with sufficient battery life. A weight of around 2.5-3 kgs and battery life of at least 4-5 hours are good expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>RAM and Storage</strong></h3>



<p>In terms of RAM, buying a laptop with less than 8GB of RAM would be redundant in 2022 and you should preferably get one with 16 gigs of RAM. 512 GB of SSD storage should be the starting point for storage.</p>



<h3><strong>Ports &amp; Other Hardware</strong></h3>



<p>Look for HDMI ports, Thunderbolt 3 or 4, at least 1 USB type C port, 2 USB Type-A ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, an ethernet port, and a full-size SD card reader on your next laptop. As for hardware, get a feel of the laptop to ensure that it is sturdy and has a high-quality keyboard and speakers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>To sum up, there are plenty of options available for people who want a gaming laptop but don’t want the design of one.</p>



<p>The Razer Blade 15 Advanced is currently the best overall pick for a gaming laptop that doesn’t look like a laptop due to its design, performance, and high quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using the following parameters will help you choose a gaming laptop that meets your needs:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the crazy potential to get out of hand during team fights to solo kills in lane, Katarina is one of the most mobile assassins that can feel unbeatable if handled poorly. Her roaming potential to snipe pushed bot or top lane gives her a chance to start <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-is-snowballing-in-lol/" data-type="post" data-id="10383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snowballing</a>, but as always, there is the rock to the scissors, and Katarina has weaknesses that you can take advantage of.</p>



<h2><strong>Katarina’s Abilities</strong></h2>



<p>Katarina&#8217;s kit is based mainly on reducing CDs of her abilities. To better understand how to avoid mistakes when dealing with her, you have to dive into her abilities and, most importantly, her passive.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Passive &#8211; Voracity: </strong>Whenever an enemy champion dies that Katarina has damaged recently, her remaining ability cooldowns are dramatically reduced. This is the bread and butter of crazy potential to get out of hand in every team fight. If Katarina picks up a Dagger, she uses it to slash through all nearby enemies, dealing magic damage. It synergizes with her Q and W, which both leave a dagger on the ground that she can pick up to deal AOE damage.</li><li><strong>Q &#8211; Bouncing Blade: </strong>She throws a dagger, which bounces from enemy to enemy before ricocheting on the ground. It can hit minions and champions as well.</li><li><strong>W &#8211; Preparation: </strong>She gains a burst of movement speed and leaves a dagger behind her.</li><li><strong>E &#8211; Shunpo: </strong>She can use E to blink to a target&#8217;s location. It can be an enemy, an ally, or her dagger from Q or W.</li><li><strong>R &#8211; Death Lotus:</strong> She starts to channel for up to 2,5 seconds, during which she throws daggers around her to up to 3 enemies. During this time, she is applying Grievous Wounds as well as AOE damage.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Countering Katarina&#8217;s Spells</strong></h2>



<p>The biggest counter to Katarina is <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard CC</a> (stuns, silences, knock-ups, displacements). Roots are not that useful. Zhonya&#8217;s Hourglass active or Guardian Angel can be very handy as well. Katarina will try to use her daggers on the ground to deal unexpected damage to you. If you see a dagger, your best bet is to stay away from it so she can not deal free damage to you. On the other hand, you can bait her E on a dagger when there is your jungler in a bush waiting to help you out.</p>

<h2><strong>Most Common Katarina Combos</strong></h2>



<p>In the laning phase, E-W-AA-picking up the dagger-Q-AA-E-picking up the dagger or Q-E-picking up the dagger-AA-W combos are used for trading with the enemies. During the early game, Katarina players use W-Q-E when the enemy is under the tower. They prepare W outside tower range, run at the enemy, throw a Q and E out.</p>



<p>All combos rely heavily on Katarina’s condition to get near the enemy and even AA to deal a significant amount of damage (except for her Q that can be used as a poke).</p>



<p>The most important thing to keep an eye on are daggers on the ground and the recent use of her E. Without her E, she is vulnerable to ganks from your jungler.</p>

<h2><strong>Katarina&#8217;s Weaknesses</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. CC</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>, CC, and CC. Katarina uses her mobility to get in and out of team fights, but if your team is able to lock her down during the dive to your <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/most-squishy-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="13284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">squishy</a> back lane, you may be able to kill her first. If you see that the enemy has already picked Katarina, try to encourage your teammates to pick champions that have CC.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Vision</strong></h3>



<p>CC. Did we mention CC already? Oh yea, we did. Jokes aside, vision is another great protection layer that you can put between you and Katarina. Well placed ward can spot her coming to your lane and you will be aware that you should keep back or even try to cooperate with other teammates to catch her off guard.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Runes optimization</strong></h3>



<p>Taking magic resistance runes will mitigate most of her damage. She does physical damage as well, but magic damage is her main output.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>4. Slow and steady</strong></h3>



<p>Try not to die early, wait for your junglers help, or play passively if you struggle against her in the early game. If you have good push potential, try to clear minions. Katarina is weak at farming under the tower.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>5. Range advantage</strong></h3>



<p>Use your range to your advantage. As we stated before, she relies on her daggers and gets close enough to you to deal a significant amount of damage.</p>



<h3><strong>6. Let others know</strong></h3>



<p>Use pings to warn your teammates that she is missing. An obvious tip, but it never hurts to remind you about the possibility of using pinging as a helpful way to communicate with other teammates.</p>



<h2><strong>The Best Katarina Lane Counters in Season 12</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Irelia</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15061" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-irelia.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Irelia is one of the most versatile and definitely strongest lane counters that you can pick against Katarina. With the gold difference of +430 gold at the 15th-minute mark, Irelia is the champion that stomps Katarina into the ground.</p>



<p>The most optimal way to win your lane as Irelia against Katarina is to play it safe until you hit level 3. If you, unfortunately, die to Katarina, she might be able to snowball from early lead to unstoppable force to the end of the match. After you survive the first three levels and buy your first items, you will be able to push Katarina under her turret, where she will be unable to farm efficiently.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Zed</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15063" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-zed.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Zed is another excellent champion to deal with Katarina. With the gold difference of +410 gold at the 15th-minute mark, Zed is another great pick that deals with Katarina very well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again the most optimal way in this matchup is to wait for his level 3 and play it safe. His Q allows him to trade, poke and farm using range to your advantage. You can even dodge part of Katarina’s combo by his R, during which he is untargetable.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Honorable mention: Tryndamere</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15062" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-lane-counters-tryndamere.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Tryndamere’s R basically denies Katarina’s reset potential and thus making her obviously desperate. His built-in healing with Q helps him with poke and chasing potential with E allows him to react to Katarina’s E.</p>



<p><strong>Also read: <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-play-against-akshan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Play Against Akshan?</a></strong></p>



<h2><strong>The Best Champions to Counter Katarina in Season 12</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>1. Kayle</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15059" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kayle.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Kayle’s R directly counters Katarina. Well-timed R to your squishy carry (Kayle as well) can turn around fight where Katarina is trying to get reset with a kill. Her range helps to deal with Katarina as well. Kayle is a scaling champion, so you have to keep that in mind. Pre 6 Kayle is unable to beat Katarina in any way.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Vladimir</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15060" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-vladimir.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Vladimir’s pool, aka W, is another annoying (read as great to counter) ability to save Vladimir from Katarina’s combos. His build-in beefiness through his passive and natural healing with Q makes him harder to deal with for all Katarina players (remember that Katarina’s R applies Grievous Wounds).</p>



<h3><strong>3. Kassadin</strong></h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15058" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-katarina-counters-kassadin.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Kassadin’s R is one of the best mobility spells in LoL. If Katarina decides to jump on you, you can quickly blink away with your R. Other reasons are that Kassadin’s passive makes him take less damage from magic, and his Q can interrupt Katarina’s R.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Katarina is tough to master champion with huge skill dependency. Her combos are very complicated, and you will be happy to see her in your team if the player mastered her to every detail. On the other hand, you will feel desperate if you hear the announcer scream Penta kill! after the team fight. But after reading our guide on how to counter her, we are sure that you will be able to win against her easily and abuse her weaknesses even further than before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pick a champion within our recommended counters that you are most familiar with and feel most comfortable playing with. If you did not find any of your favorite champions from our list, try to pick something that has reliable CC. Try to save it for her and lead your team to a victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When playing a video game like League of Legends, precision is everything, especially if you want to land those crucial skill shots. For this reason, I recommend adjusting your settings in a way that is just for you, allowing you the opportunity to use your mouse to its utmost potential.</p>



<p>This is rare, but there are some patches that cause those in-game settings, such as your mouse sensitivity, to reset without any warning. When this happens to you for the first time, it’s going to catch you off guard. You could end up stuck with a slow cursor so it may take you some time to fix the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re like many gamers, you may rely on your Windows’ cursor settings, and there is nothing wrong with this – you will need to tab out of the match so that you can fi it. Via the in-game settings, you’ll be able to get up to speed, so no worries there. </p>



<p>When that cursor speed drops in League of Legends, it can be downright frustrating. I’m going to save you from those frustrating moments – here’s what you can do in order to fix the dropping cursor speed in League of Legends:</p>

<h2><strong>Look at Your Windows Cursor Settings</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15054" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-1024x576.png 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-300x169.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-768x432.png 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-1536x864.png 1536w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-150x84.png 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-750x422.png 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends-1140x641.png 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-league-of-legends.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>First things first, you’re going to want to head over to your windows cursor settings and check that out.</p>



<p>A good amount of LoL player base doesn’t change any of their sensitivity settings through League’s in-game menus, and that is understandable. They choose to keep everything at their default values, and when you choose to do this, League if going to automatically go to your default Windows configurations and fetch the settings from there.</p>



<p>Whenever a patch comes out that manages to reset your cursor settings, you will need to go in there and adjust your cursor settings back to where you had them.</p>



<p><em>If you’re using Windows 10, here are some steps for you to follow:</em></p>



<ul><li>Open the Start Panel on Windows and type “Mouse.”</li><li>From there, click on “Mouse Settings,” and select “Additional mouse options.”</li><li>After you have done this, a tiny interface will pop up in front of you and during this time, you will need to navigate to “Pointer Options.”</li><li>You may notice the adjuster has been placed back in the middle, and you will need to slide it to where it originally was in order to fix your sensitivity in League of Legends.</li></ul>



<h2><strong>Fix Your League sensitivity Through Options</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="574" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-1024x574.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15053" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-1024x574.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-300x168.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-768x430.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-150x84.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-750x420.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol-1140x639.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fixing-mouse-lag-in-lol.jpg 1272w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Okay, so you have adjusted your league sensitivity through the game’s settings. You will now need to make those same adjustments to fix your sensitivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Follow these steps:</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>If you’re in a match, you can press “ESC,” which will bring up the options menu, or click on the cog icon that can be found at the top right corner of your screen.&nbsp;</li><li>Click on “Game” and start adjusting your “Mouse Speed” to the previous value.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>If you don’t remember what your mouse speed was, then you will need to experiment until you find the sped that fits your playstyle.</p>



<h2><strong>Advice to Help You Remember Your Settings</strong></h2>



<p>The error rarely ever happens, but when it does, it can be frustrating, and it’s even more frustrating when you can’t remember what your previous settings were. For this reason, I recommend taking a screenshot of your Windows sensitivity options, along with your in-game configurations as this can help you recover those settings right away.</p>



<h3><strong>Fixing Windows 10 Mouse Lag</strong><strong></strong></h3>



<p>In Windows 10, mouse lag can be very annoying, especially when you’re playing League of Legends. Not only does Windows 10 mouse lag slow down your productivity and lead to mistakes while you’re trying to create documents, it can also interfere with gameplay.</p>



<p>Some people can go years without realizing they’re dealing with mouse lag, but there are scenarios where mouse lag can become noticeable.</p>



<h4><strong>Common Scenarios Where Mouse Lag is Noticeable:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>While Playing Games – The most common scenario where you’ll notice mouse lag is while playing games – the game stop responding to your mouse movements, and this can be very frustrating.</li><li>Word Document – While you’re scrolling down a Word document and the scroll bar continue to pause, even when you’re scrolling.&nbsp;</li><li>Multiple Clicks – Your computer isn’t responding to the mouse clicks, so you have to click on one application two or more times.</li></ul>



<p>This form of mouse lag can happen when you have a lot of programs/apps running on your computer at one time. So, before attempting the troubleshooting tips I’m about to give you, first make sure you have all apps closed.</p>

<h2><strong>The Cause of Mouse Lag on Windows 10</strong></h2>



<p>Mouse lag just so happens to be one of the most common issues Windows 10 users face. This is because there are actually numerous reasons as to why a mouse could be lagging. It could be anything from misconfigured mouse setting, a recent driver update, or a bad wireless mouse battery causing the lag.</p>



<p>The fastest way to get you back on your feet and eliminate that lag so that you can play League of Legends (mouse lag-free) would be to start by taking a look at the hardware itself (that’s the mouse). From there, work your way through the components and applications that work together to make your muse function as it should.</p>



<p>Look at Your Mouse First – If you have a wireless mouse, you should put new batteries in. If you have a wired mouse, try unplugging it from your computer and plugging it back in. By doing this, you will be restarting your driver and hopefully, this will have the mouse working properly.</p>



<p><em><strong>Still having issues with the mouse lag? Here are a couple of tricks which may be of help to you:</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Clean the Wireless Mouse</strong> – If you notice the lag happening in spurts or if the lag is intermittent, this could be because there is dirt covering the IR sensor that is under the mouse. If the mouse scrolling is lagging, this could be because there is dirt stuck in the scroll wheel of the mouse. Try cleaning the mouse (a q-tip should work).</p>



<p><strong>Test the Mouse</strong> – You should test the mouse on another computer so you can be certain it’s the mouse. If you don’t have another computer, try using it with your PS4, Xbox, or iPad. If you discover the mouse works fine on another device, but it doesn’t do so hot on your Windows 10 computer, then you now know that the problem is with your computer and not your mouse. </p>



<p><strong>Different USB Port </strong>– Take the mouse and plug it into a different USB port on your computer. More specifically, if you were originally plugged into a USB 3.0 port on your computer, switch it to a USB 2.0 port.&nbsp; If you discover it’s the USB port the mouse was originally plugged into, then you will need to troubleshoot that particular USB port itself.</p>



<p><strong>Fast Startup</strong> – Fast startup can also have an impact on your mouse. Many people love this Windows 10 feature as it quickly starts the computer. However, it can cause mouse lag, so if you are experiencing mouse lag, try disabling fast startup, restarting your computer, and see if that gets rid of the lag.</p>



<p>Power Saving Mode – Windows Power Saving Mode can also have an effect on mouse behavior.  If you’re using a laptop that is not plugged in, then Windows may try to turn off the USB port in order to conserve power. So go ahead and Disable Power Saving Mode and see if this fixed the mouse lag issue you’re having.</p>



<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>If you’re still experiencing mouse lag while playing League of Legends, try uninstalling the 3<sup>rd</sup> party gaming software that came with the mouse. There are a variety of gaming peripherals that are used to play LoL, but they don’t control the development of software that comes with it. If you’re experiencing mouse lag in League of Legends with a custom mouse (or even a custom keyboard) and you’re running 3<sup>rd</sup> party software that controls them, you may want to uninstall the software and see if the issue stops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Communication is crucial in first-person shooters like Valorant, and you can see in the myriad of ways you can communicate with your teammates. Party chat, team chat, and even team voice chat are all proper channels to message your team about necessary information to win the match.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if you feel this playful need to trash talk or randomly hit up someone on the enemy side, Valorant also has your back. You can access all chat where everyone in the match, including the enemy team, can see and read.</p>



<h2><strong>Typing to All Players in Valorant</strong></h2>



<p>There are two ways to send a message to all chat. The most convenient way is to press Shift+Enter, which will prefix “/all ” immediately, then you can type your message after it. Pressing Enter again will send the message to all chat; you can tell by looking at the chatbox and seeing if it has “(All)” before your message.</p>



<p>Another way to send a message to all chat is to press Enter and manually type “/all “ before your message. Don’t forget the space after the “/all” or the game won’t send the message to all chat.</p>



<p>Now, you’re ready to send your well-wishes, trash talk, or try your luck to scout a better teammate from the enemy team!</p>

<h2><strong>What is Butterfly Clicking?</strong></h2>



<p>Have you noticed that when a person&#8217;s hand lifts or moves off a mouse, it loses contact with the desk, which changes the input? Moving your hands slightly up and down in a fast motion allows for more accurate clicking since your hand is constantly in contact with the desk.</p>



<p>Butterfly clicking, otherwise known as &#8220;tweaking,&#8221; is a technique used by many gamers to have an advantage at their favorite games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this technique, gamers can play faster and more precisely because they don&#8217;t have to worry about lifting their hands from the mouse pad to click on items on-screen, the same goes for keyboard chords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some players find butterfly clicking just feels better since they&#8217;re not held back by drag from their palms being pressed against a mousepad or other surface.</p>



<h2><strong>Is Butterfly Clicking Allowed?</strong></h2>



<p>Go to any competitive game, and you&#8217;ll see the pros using butterfly clicking. But what about those who play for fun? The answer is &#8211; it&#8217;s up to you! To be clear, there isn&#8217;t a rule that says that butterfly clicking is forbidden, but some gaming companies prohibit their players from doing it.</p>



<p>If an online game has its own rules against this technique, it&#8217;s best not to do it; your account may get banned if anyone reports your activity as cheating. The mouse manufacturers themselves also sometimes will put out statements forbidding players from using this or other styles of clicks too.</p>



<p>However, if there are no specific policies banning butterfly clicking for the games you enjoy playing offline or online, then yes&#8211;you can use this technique to your advantage! It is perfectly acceptable and encouraged.</p>

<p>Razer is a name associated with high-end computers and other devices, such as mice. The Razer Naga Trinity is one of the best mice on the market, featuring three detachable side plates that have two, seven, and twelve buttons, respectively.</p>



<p>It also boasts a staggering 19 programmable buttons, allowing you to remap and apply complex macro functions to meet your unique gaming needs. Use a lot of hotkeys? This mouse is for you. Otherwise, you can simply use the basic two-button plate when you need something simple.</p>



<p>The mechanical buttons of the Razer&nbsp; Trinity can withstand up to 50 million clicks, making it a suitable mouse for butterfly clicking.</p>



<p>Above all, its buttons provide audible feedback to confirm that the click has been detected while also preventing accidental clicks.</p>



<p>These buttons may be changed using the Razer Synapse software to allow for more personalized usage. As a result, it&#8217;s safe to say that the Razer Naga Trinity is the most popular butterfly mouse.</p>



<h3><strong>Why Is This the Best Gaming Mouse for Butterfly Clicking in 2022?</strong></h3>



<p>While it seems to be a simple mouse, the Razer Naga Trinity offers a lot more than you may think. It offers Chroma RGB Color Profiles that are subtle and adaptable. It is also very convenient to use because of the small, tactile bumps that make it easier to grip and make scrolling easier in high-stakes games. It features long-lasting mechanical switches that can withstand up to 50 million clicks.</p>

<p>The Razer Optical Mouse Switches allow the mouse to respond at the speed of light, with a reaction time of 0.2 milliseconds. This was made possible by Razer&#8217;s use of infrared light, which emits a beam each time you press a key. These optical switches can endure up to 70 million clicks.</p>



<p>The mouse features an inbuilt memory that allows you to store up to five different settings for multiple users or games. The designed shape is quite comfortable in the hands and provides users with strength.</p>



<p>There are eight buttons on the mouse, with two main click panels, two DPI-switch buttons in the middle column on top of the mouse, and a scroll button. There are also forward and back buttons on each side and an extra button on the bottom.</p>



<p>It includes a smart tracking mechanism for a better Mousepad experience. The company says that the switch is 3x faster than standard switches and that the cable is drag-free for a wireless experience.</p>



<p>Overall, The Razer DeathAdder V2 is a great choice if you want a lightweight, super-fast mouse for butterfly clicking.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Choose the Best Mouse for Butterfly Clicking?</strong></h2>



<p>When looking for a mouse to use for butterfly clicking, there are a few things you should consider. The following are some of the most important factors to think about when making your decision:</p>



<h3><strong>Ergonomics</strong></h3>



<p>When it comes to gaming mice, you want one that feels comfortable in your hand. You&#8217;ll be using it for long periods of time, so it&#8217;s important that it&#8217;s not only physically comfortable but also fits your grip well. Some mice have different ergonomic designs, so be sure to choose one that feels best for you.</p>



<h3><strong>Sensor Type</strong></h3>



<p>The sensor type is important because it affects how precise your mouse will be. Optical sensors are the most popular type and are very accurate, while laser sensors are the most efficient. Make sure that there are specific drivers for your mouse if you want to change how it works, but in most cases, the defaults should suffice.</p>



<h3><strong>Adjustable DPI Settings</strong></h3>



<p>Make sure that you choose a mouse that has adjustable DPI settings to allow for more precise movements during gameplay. This is especially important for butterfly clickers since they want as many accurate clicks per minute as possible! Don&#8217;t rely on your mouse&#8217;s default settings if you plan on using this technique.</p>



<h3><strong>Programmable Buttons &amp; Macros</strong></h3>



<p>Programmable buttons and macros are a plus but not necessary for success in the gaming world. If you personally find these features useful, make sure your mouse has them. However, if you prefer simplicity, there are plenty of mice out there without these extra settings that can still do a great job!</p>



<h3><strong>Comfort</strong></h3>



<p>Comfort is extremely important when playing games for long periods of time or competitively since you need to be able to feel confident in knowing that your hand will feel good even after hours of playtime&#8211;and it should certainly look good too! So remember, the best mouse for butterfly clicking is one that feels good in your hand and makes you want to game more!</p>



<h3><strong>Price</strong></h3>



<p>You don&#8217;t necessarily need to spend a fortune on a mouse that can cater to your butterfly clicking desires. It&#8217;s good to try and find the perfect balance between price and quality, so do what you can without breaking the bank! Some of the best gaming mice out there are quite affordable&#8211;and if you&#8217;re just looking for something simple as a backup or as a gift, there are plenty of great options available under $30.</p>



<h3><strong>Warranty</strong></h3>



<p>Make sure that you choose a mouse with at least a 1-year warranty from the manufacturer in case there are any defects or malfunctions. This way, should anything happen to your mouse, whether through accident or other means, you know that you&#8217;re covered under warranty and can get a replacement quickly.</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>There are plenty of mice that cater to butterfly clicking and come with a variety of features. You can find one for your needs by looking at our list of the top 7 best mouses for butterfly clicking in 2022. Make sure to consider the factors outlined above before buying a mouse for butterfly clicking so that you know exactly what to look for.

<p>The Support Role in League of Legends is likely the most difficult to play. Rivaled only perhaps by the Jungle, Supports take a lot of time, effort, and skill to learn and master. And even then, you never know what may happen as synergy between you and your fellow ADC is also paramount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help you ease yourself into the Role or make things easier overall if you’re already vested in the Support world, we’ve decided to compile a list of Champions that strive in the Laning Phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Laning Phase is extremely important and probably the most important part of the game. It serves as a setup for the things to come. A team that dominates the Laning Phase severely will, in all likelihood, emerge victorious from the game. Though there are exceptions to this rule, it is a widespread occurrence that must not be overlooked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These Champions are not only viable for the Laning Phase; all of them have their utility outside of the Lane as well, which we will go over when we get to the list.</p>



<p>Not to drag too much, let us begin with the <strong>5 Best Laning Phase Supports in League of Legends! </strong>(This list is in no particular order.)&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Thresh</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15029" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-thresh.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Thresh is one of the most challenging Support Champions, as indicated in our <strong>Hardest Supports</strong> list that you should definitely check out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This difficulty stems from his heavy reliance on accurate skill shots. Hitting these skill shots, however, will yield all the benefits you can think of. They are handy during the early Laning Phase, and here’s why.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thresh can apply a lot of pressure on the opposing duo and represents a constant threat of engagement whenever he gets even the slightest opening. The enemy will persistently try to hide behind minions and cower in fear not to get hooked. Landing hooks is lethal and has a high chance of getting a kill, especially when followed by Thresh’s E.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These two spells alone are great early game CC that, when combined with the right Champions, will allow you to get kills and a lot of farm while denying minions to the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though difficult, he’s a fantastic pick for both the Laning Phase and late-game encounters. He can close the gap quickly and allow your team to focus on a single valuable target, eliminating them efficiently. He’s often a Tank, so he’ll have no issue engaging opponents, and mastering his combos will only increase his impact on your games.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Leona</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15027" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-leona.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Leona is one of the heaviest Supports in the game. I say this due to just how much CC she has. She feels like a heavy Champion that, when she attaches herself to you, she obliterates you on the spot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She’s not too difficult to play, though not as easy either. She’s heavily reliant on skill shots – her E and Ultimate are some of the most valuable spells to have on a team, and they need to be accurately used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leona has some of the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/longest-cc-abilities/" data-type="post" data-id="11546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most robust CC </a>in her kit, allowing her to stun opponents for ages. The cooldowns are not too bad either, making her a constant threat within the Lane. Her E goes through minions, meaning that hiding behind them isn’t an option against this Champion. </p>



<p>This gives Leona a lot of zoning power, and a good Leona player will use her intimidating nature to keep the enemy away from the farm as much as possible. Overextension is an issue with noob Leona players that think she’s omnipotent, and you should be aware of that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A good combination with Leona would be Lucian whose high <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/dps-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="13394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DPS</a> in the early game can capitalize on her abundant <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/what-does-cc-mean-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="9722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CC</a>. She’s always been an excellent Support pick, and whenever I included her in a list – I gave her a strong recommendation, and this one is no exception.  </p>

<h2><strong>3. Pantheon</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15028" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-pantheon.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Pantheon is usually a Champion that you’d see on the Top Lane. Lately, though, he’s found his way into the Support Role. And he’s doing pretty good at it, with solid win rates in high and low Elo rankings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to his Fighter nature and his Top Lane design, Pantheon is exceptionally aggressive. He can engage and take very little damage using his W and E, allowing for some profitable trades. If he happens to get zoned back, he can use his long-range Q to poke the enemy for solid damage safely. Pantheon can do a ton of damage, something that only gets better as the game progresses.</p>



<p>Near the end of the Laning Phase, he’s already one great, engaging Champion that can start fights and isolate crucial targets. As I’ve said, he also possesses excellent range, allowing for some nice starting damage to get the chances in your favor before the fight even begins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He’s super easy to play, though his Q does take a bit of getting used to. Once you master this otherwise amazing Bruiser, you’ve got a great Champion on your hands that can do many great things.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Karma</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15026" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-karma.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Karma is undoubtedly my favorite Support to play. As a Top Lane main, I don’t verse myself into the Support Role that often (or ever, honestly.) But sometimes, that pesky auto-fill finds its way to me and sends me on the path of Supporting – and Karma is always my choice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She is one of the strongest Laning Phase Champions damage-wise in the entire game. At level 1, she can already use her Ultimate to amplify her Q and deal massive Magic damage, setting the enemy at an immediate disadvantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This continues throughout the Laning Phase, and she’ll poke and harass a lot with her extraordinary range and damage. If the enemy retaliates, she has tools against that, too. Using her W, she can put a solid CC onto an enemy. Though not as effective as Leona’s stuns, this root acts as a solid disable to help Karma and her laner retreat to safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her E is a great shield that only gets better with her Ultimate. It can have an <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/aoe-damage/" data-type="post" data-id="10434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AOE</a> effect, shielding and boosting the movement speed of both Karma and her ally. All of this is possible from level 3 and above, as Karma has her Ultimate unlocked from the get-go. </p>



<p>She’s a potent Enchanter that I believe superior over the likes of Lux and Seraphine. Her damage is just too severe, and her mobility isn’t lacking in the slightest. I genuinely recommend this Champion for any skill level, as she doesn’t take that much to get used to or learn.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>5. Amumu</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15025" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-laning-supports-amumu.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Amumu has been an S+ tier Jungler since his kit was updated. Though it was a minor update per se, it severely changed how good Amumu can be, and that is not only true for the Jungle but his other viable Roles as well. One of those Roles is, of course, the Support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like Leona, Amumu can apply heavy pressure and scare the enemies into submission with his constant circling around the minions. He’s a tank right off the bat and can only get tankier from there. This allows him to engage without too much fear, and his primary tool of attack will be his two charge Q. If both charges are hit, they will amount to a 2s stun, well enough time to kill just about any target in the game, let alone an ADC or Support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d say he synergizes best with the same Champions Leona does – Lucian, Tristana, and other <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-dps-champions/" data-type="post" data-id="13397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high DPS Champions</a> that don’t take too long to do damage even in the Laning Phase. </p>



<p>He’s straightforward and powerful both on the Lane and outside of it. His team fighting potential is notorious, and that Ultimate speaks for itself. If he hits level 6 quickly on the Lane – it’s pretty much game over for the opposing side, and they will not be able to win a single fight after that. Although I’d watch out for overextending and pick my fights, isolating is always better than going head-on into a group.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>As I’ve claimed at the beginning, the Laning Phase is an essential part of the game. Having the right Champions picked for this phase can decide matches in the Champion Select.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, some Champions may be weak in the Laning Phase but dominate the game later on.</p>



<p> An excellent example of this is Kai’Sa, a <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-hyper-carries/" data-type="post" data-id="9744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hyper carry</a> with a notoriously weak Laning Phase and perhaps the <a href="https://egamesconsult.com/best-late-game-adcs/" data-type="post" data-id="12887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Late Game ADC</a>. At any rate, doing well early on is a critical factor for the game’s eventual outcome. </p>

<p>There are certain champions in League of Legends that you rarely see, and one of those champions is Bard. He provides decent healing and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-peel-in-league-of-legends/" data-type="post" data-id="8589" target="_blank">peels</a>, but not enough to be relevant for season 12. But when he is partnered with particular ADC&#8217;s, it won&#8217;t matter if he&#8217;s meta or not.

<h2><strong>1. Sivir</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15016" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-sivir.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Bard excels in heals for his champion, and when enemies get close enough, he can slow and stun them. That is pretty much it for his laning phase. But combine him with a champion that has a pretty strong wave clear, then you have yourself a duo that can quickly roam because of Bard&#8217;s Magical Journey.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Sivir can quickly dispose of the oncoming enemy wave during mid-game and proceed to roam mid with Bard. They can also work together with their jungle to counter the jungle enemy team. Doing this would put a massive lead on your team and excellent<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/how-to-get-better-at-warding-in-league/" data-type="post" data-id="8478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> map control</a>. Sivir relies on her Q damage most of the time, along with her movement speed. Sure, she can self-peel using her spell shield, but when her skills come on cooldown, she gets very vulnerable as she lacks dash skills except for her flash. This is where Bard comes in. Bard has great roaming potential because of his high movement speed provided by his passive, the Meeps. Bard can quickly run towards Sivir and provide her peeling and heals. Bard can also use his ultimate to either set up a fight or protect his running teammates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bard and Sivir can combine their skills for the best peeling technique. When Sivir gets gap closed by the enemy bruisers, Bard can cast his ultimate directly on Sivir. She can use her spell shield to make herself immune from Bard&#8217;s ult, this would turn enemies beside Sivir to Gold, and she can run unaffected and able to move.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Best Item to Build on Bard for Sivir</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Shurelya&#8217;s Reverie</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="588" height="311" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-sivir.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15021" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-sivir.png 588w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-sivir-300x159.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-sivir-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></figure></div>



<p>This Item is excellent for initiating team fights or disengaging. This would work for a quick in-and-out pick. But most importantly, this would work with Sivir as it would extend Sivir&#8217;s much-needed movement speed. Sivir can cast her ultimate to provide her a burst of movement speed along with her allies. Bard can also follow up if they need it again to chase or run away from an enemy. The regens and cooldown reduction also work so well for Bard.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>2. Caitlyn</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15013" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-caitlyn.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Caitlyn can dominate most ADC&#8217;s on the bot lane simply because she has a more extended range than them. Her basic attacks and skills can be cast at ranges farther than other ADC&#8217;s. Caitlyn also has her ultimate, which is basically a sniper, which you probably know so much about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like all ADC&#8217;s, Caitlyn also needs heals to help her survive the lane, but their synergy comes when Bard casts his crowd control abilities. Bard can stun enemies using his Q ability. Enemies caught by his Q will be slowed, and when a wall or another unit is behind them, both units will be stunned. Caitlyn can take advantage of this and cast her W ability to root them even longer. Caitlyn can deal bonus damage on enemies caught by her W, and if you play Caitlyn well, you can follow it up on a quick burst of combo.</p>



<p>Another thing that this duo can do is bait enemies into Bard&#8217;s magical journey. Enemies will come out of it, and Bard can stun them against the wall pinning them into location. Caitlyn can also use her trap at the end of the tunnel and follow it up with a quick burst combo. With this duo, you can have a massive impact on the entire map because of the range of their skills, along with their excellent roaming potential.</p>



<h3><strong>The Best Item to Build on Bard for Caitlyn</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Locket of the Iron Solari</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="588" height="311" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-caitlyn.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15018" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-caitlyn.png 588w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-caitlyn-300x159.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-caitlyn-150x79.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></figure></div>



<p>Caitlyn is susceptible to bursts from assassins or DPS from champions with poisons or burns like Brand&#8217;s. Locket counters those things with a blast of shield from its active ability. This item also has a unique passive that gives nearby allied champions 5 bonus armor and magic resist. An item that offers a very squishy champion its much-needed survivability.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>3. Miss Fortune</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15015" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-miss-fortune.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Miss Fortune depends on her allies&#8217; crowd control abilities to help her land her skills. She can build different paths, a crit build that relies on her basic attacks for damage which doesn&#8217;t need any CC help from her allies. Another build is a lethality build that empowers her ultimate.<br>Bard can help set up kills for Miss Fortune. One basic combo they can do during the laning phase is for Bard to land his stun on both the enemy duo. They will be perfectly aligned for MF&#8217;s Q double shot. Follow it up with her E slow ability and back away. This is a simple but strong trading technique with this duo to win the lane early on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Miss Fortune also excels in the late game, so she needs all the babysitting she can get during the early game. Bard provides just that with his heals and crowd controls. During the late game, whatever MF&#8217;s build is, Bard can set up kills for her. Bard can land his ult on multiple enemy team members to prepare for MF&#8217;s E + R combo. This could quickly decimate the enemy team, causing them to back off or disengage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Best Item to Build on Bard for Miss Fortune</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Mikael&#8217;s Blessing</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="592" height="271" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-miss-fortune.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15020" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-miss-fortune.png 592w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-miss-fortune-300x137.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-miss-fortune-150x69.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></figure></div>



<p>Miss Fortune lacks self-peeling abilities, so she badly needs her support. Mikael&#8217;s Blessing would be a great addition to Bard&#8217;s already fantastic arsenal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Xayah</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15017" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-xayah.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Xayah was once very popular as an ADC; she is commonly used on the world&#8217;s stage, and for a good reason. She has decent damage output and great range. She also has a self-peel ability which is her ultimate that makes her untargetable for a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Xayah and Bard are powerful duos because of their abilities to peel for themselves. Bard can give her heals during the laning phase. Planting multiple ones beside the tower, Xayah can ultimately trade with the enemy ADC during the early game. As she has guaranteed heals waiting for her, just a few steps behind. One of her primary damage sources comes from pulling her passive ability towards her. </p>



<p>This can easily be set with Bard&#8217;s ultimate, which puts the enemy team on stasis for a few seconds. Xayah can put as many feathers as she can before bard ults the enemy team. Just as when they are about to come out of stasis, Xayah can pull her feathers towards her for an intense burst of damage. If some survive, she can surely kill them as she also has high range and damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Bard, you can build on utility active items to protect your Xayah so she can prioritize building herself damaged items. They can both play aggressively in the early or late game, given that Bard lands his ult and Q at the right place and time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>5. Ezreal</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="1024" height="604" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-1024x604.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-15014" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-1024x604.jpg 1024w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-300x177.jpg 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-768x453.jpg 768w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-150x89.jpg 150w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-750x443.jpg 750w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal-1140x673.jpg 1140w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-adcs-for-bard-lol-ezreal.jpg 1215w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Perhaps the best champion to partner with Bard can self-peel and have a long-range to stay safe as Bard<a href="https://egamesconsult.com/leagueoflegend/4-best-roaming-mid-laners/" data-type="post" data-id="9277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> roams the map</a>. Ezreal excels just that. This type of strategy is called a weak side play which the lane doesn&#8217;t require that much assistance from his other allies.</p>



<p>Bard can leave his health skills besides the tower for Ezreal to use, and he can then proceed to roam the other lanes to help them. This would be highly beneficial to the team as Ezreal can farm solo with his gold and exp. Bard also puts leads on his other teammates as the game goes on. Once Ezreal builds the core items, Bard can go back to him and give him assistance to secure kills so they can both snowball into winning the game.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The Best Item to Build on Bard for Ezreal</strong></h3>



<h4><strong>Redemption</strong></h4>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img width="592" height="285" src="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-ezreal.png" alt="" class="wp-image-15019" srcset="/leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-ezreal.png 592w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-ezreal-300x144.png 300w, /leagueoflegend/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/best-bard-items-to-supp-ezreal-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px" /></figure></div>



<p>As Bard spends most of his time roaming the map, warding enemy jungle camps, or helping secure kills in the mid or top lane, he also needs to influence the bot lane. Redemption is perfect as this Item has a very long range that can heal allies and damage enemies caught within its range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So those are the 5 best champions you can pick as an ADC when you have a Bard support. Remember that the best champions to partner Bard with are champions with long-range or self-peel abilities as Bard is a champion meant to roam the entire map. His passive the meeps are scattered throughout the map; picking one up gives him movement speed which would really help him roam the other lanes. So even though Bard has a low pick rate, I hope you know when is the best time to pick him. GLHF on your next game summoner, see you on the rift.</p>
